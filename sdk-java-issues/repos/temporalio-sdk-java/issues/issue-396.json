Different users of the SDK have different opinions on how this name should be generated. For example, see [this forum post](url).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe proposal is to make activity name generation pluggable through ClientOptions and WorkerOptions. This way each user can implement its own standard to name activities automatically.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Capturing our requirement. \r\n1. Say I have a DB table migration activity (\"migrateTable\") and based on need we might end up calling the same activity multiple times for migrating n Tables \r\n2.  We would like to see the activities as \"migrateTable1\", \"migrateTable2\"... instead of \"migrateTable \r\n3. We have defined a name for Activity (using Annotation) \r\n4. We are able to change the AcvityName in Workflow Implementation code by overriding name Annotation value.\r\n5. The challenge lies in Registering and Starting workers; as we might not know how many times we will end up calling the activity (hence different Names) during workflow execution (in case we are calling the Actitvity in loop).\r\n\r\nIs there a workaround or can  we Map same Activity in Worker to Renamed Activities in Workflow Implementation call.\r\nPlease suggest... where to make this code change in Java SDk\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nKrishnendu",
