  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIf users call getResultAsync on the same stub several times or if they call getResultAsync on different stubs for the same workflow execution, SDK will open a new long poll for each such request.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSDK should deduplicate such calls and open only one long poll under the hood as an optimization, so users don't have to think about it in their code.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis task should likely be paired with https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1212, as both require changes in the internal structure of the same area of SDK code.\r\n",
