  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI would like to monitor the state of Temporal Java SDK and workers through spring-boot-actuator's /health endpoint\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIn the `temporal-spring-boot-autoconfigure-alpha` project, create a HealthIndicator and AutoConfiguration that includes information on the connection, state of the workers, and anything else that could be of value for health.\r\n\r\nCould use [RabbitHealthIndicator](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/main/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/amqp/RabbitHealthIndicator.java) and [RabbitHealthContributorAutoConfiguration](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/main/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-actuator-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/actuate/autoconfigure/amqp/RabbitHealthContributorAutoConfiguration.java) as an starting point.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSplit monitoring health of workers and temporal connection into separate health indicators\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nHealthIndicator allows external monitoring tools to check whether the application has entered a failed state and needs a restart.\r\n",
