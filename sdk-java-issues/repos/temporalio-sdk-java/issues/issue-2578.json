  "body": "## Expected Behavior\n\nThe JavaDoc for `startUpdate` should indicate that when it's called with a `waitForStage` of `WorkflowUpdateStage.COMPLETED`, it's synchronous and blocks until the update is completed.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\nThe JavaDoc for `startUpdate` says the following:\n\n```text\nStart a zero argument update workflow request asynchronously.\n```\n\nHowever, the following code will block until the update is completed:\n\n```kotlin\nval updateOptions =\n  UpdateOptions.newBuilder<UpdateResult>()\n    .setResultClass(UpdateResult::class.java)\n    .setWaitForStage(WorkflowUpdateStage.COMPLETED)\n    .setUpdateId(updateId)\n    .build()\nval update = WorkflowClient.startUpdate(stub::doUpdate, updateOptions) // <-- blocks here\nval result = update.getResult(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)\n```\n\nThe JavaDoc implies that `startUpdate` would ignore the `waitForStage`, always be asynchronous, and block on the `update.getResult`.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n  1. Look at JavaDoc for `startUpdate`\n  2. Assume `startUpdate` is always asynchronous \n  1. Call `startUpdate` with a `waitForStage` of `WorkflowUpdateStage.COMPLETED`\n  1. See that the `startUpdate` call was actually synchronous\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: latest [master](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/4afe41b6ca638775e4e6ecaa3a5171b32670f9d4/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java#L704)\n  - Platform: n/a\n\n---\n\nRequesting that either the word `asynchronously` is removed from the JavaDoc for the `startUpdate` methods or it's clear that the function isn't asynchronous in a normal sense.\n\nThanks!",
