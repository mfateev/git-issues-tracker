Please describe.**\r\n[This Slack thread](https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/C05JRT1GKEE/p1735812460229109?thread_ts=1735802152.698209&cid=C05JRT1GKEE): a user had a question about this Exception, and they asked Kapa, and Kapa gave a wrong answer (which Tiho corrected 🙏 ). I suspect Kapa could have given better direction if this exception message contained the info that Tiho corrected with.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI ported Tiho's response over to the code and submitted a [PR](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/pull/2360)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI recognize that the message I'm putting here is less general than the one that was there previously. If any of it is incorrect in more general scenarios, please correct me 👍 👍 \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n",
