  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\nAdd support for Jackson 3, the next major version of the library the SDK uses for JSON serialization.  \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd support for Jackson 3 to the Java SDK. This would mainly involve creating a new Jackson 3 JSON data converter, and any other place the SDK calls into Jackson. Since Jackson 3 requires Java 17 at least we will need to support both for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Additional context**\n* Spring Boot 4 only has plans to support Jackson 3 long term https://spring.io/blog/2025/10/07/introducing-jackson-3-support-in-spring\n* https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/blob/main/jackson3/MIGRATING_TO_JACKSON_3.md",
