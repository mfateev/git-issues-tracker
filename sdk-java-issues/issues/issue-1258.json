  "body": "Right now we don't retry failed heartbeats and just ignore the error.\r\nThis may create a problem if heartbeat timeout is, for example, 20 seconds and activity heartbeats every 15 seconds. If we get a network blip, such an activity will be terminated with heartbeat timeout.\r\nWe should use heartbeatExecutor to schedule an asynchronous retry for a failed heartbeat. We can utilize an exponential backoff throttling strategy for it. ActivityContext.heartbeat() shouldn't be kept blocked because we retry.\r\n",
