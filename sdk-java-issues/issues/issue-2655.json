  "body": "## Expected Behavior\nWhen using ContinueAsNew with the testing server, the requested Memo and Search Attributes should be propagated into the new workflow execution.\n\nThis is what the production Temporal server does.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nThe memo and search attributes in the command are dropped. See [here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/31d044cfb67a29f456d0f699296e40cd4f05eb1e/temporal-test-server/src/main/java/io/temporal/internal/testservice/TestWorkflowService.java?plain=1#L1531-L1571) for where the start request is constructed—the memo and search attributes are not extracted from the `ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionCommandAttributes`.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n  1. Start a testing server\n  2. Run a workflow that uses continue-as-new with search attributes / memo\n\n## Specifications\n  - Version: v1.31.0\n  - Platform: all\n",
