Please describe.**\r\nI am writing unit tests for activity with `TestActivityEnvironment`, and using `var workflowType = Activity.getExecutionContext().getInfo().getWorkflowType();` in my activity. \r\n\r\nThere is no way to populate this execution context for as of now other then creating a temporary workflow using `TestWorkflowEnvironment` and creating a sample workflow. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I should be able to setup execution context for tests without any interactions with workflows.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSomething like below would be nice.\r\n```\r\nTestActivityEnvironment.newInstance(TestEnvironmentOptions.newBuilder().setActivityExecutionContext(...).build())\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSetting up test environment workflow, which is very tedious for unit tests.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSee https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTT84KXK9/p1712848268603179\r\n",
