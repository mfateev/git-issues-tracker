  "body": "## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nI have a bunch of local activities with retry options configured that are being ran inside a cancellation scope like so:\r\n```\r\nval scope = Workflow.newCancellationScope { _ -> \r\n  activity1.execute()\r\n  ....\r\n  activityN.execute()\r\n}\r\nWorkflow.newTimer(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\r\n  .thenApply { scope.cancel() }\r\n\r\nscope.run()\r\n```\r\nI expected that when **scope.cancel()** method is called that would close the scope with the running activities just as it works with normal activities.\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nActivities proceed to retry, the code after scope.run() doesn't execute\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.13.0\r\n  - Platform: Java\r\n",
