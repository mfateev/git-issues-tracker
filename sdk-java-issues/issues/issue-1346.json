  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRight now when workflow performs local activities, the workflow executor thread is retained and idling.\r\nThis is a simple solution, but it puts users in a tricky situation when they need to take into account the specific profile of their local activities when they set a number of workflow executor threads.\r\nIt also leads to a potentially uneven load and wasted resources. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWorkflow executor thread shouldn't actively wait for local activities completion and release the thread.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe solution requires significant restructuring of workflow executor worker code.\r\nImplementation should implement backpressure correctly. If Worker has a lot of workflow executor threads, but no free local activity worker threads, workflow can't make a progress and will be snowballing errors in the system.\r\n",
