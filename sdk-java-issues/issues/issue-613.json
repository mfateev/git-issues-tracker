Please describe.**\r\nWhen a workflow is started synchronously using a typed stub it reconnects to an already running instance if `WorkflowIdReusePolicy` is not `AllowDuplicate`.\r\n\r\nWhen a workflow method is called on a stub that was created using a workflowId (see [newWorkflowStub(Class<T> workflowInterface, String workflowId)](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/1813f6a3f5c80196bc0c7167e1708e0dcaee217b/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowClient.java#L155)) an exception is returned. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhen a workflow stub is created by a workflowId and the workflow method is invoked then the call should block waiting for a workflow result if a workflow with the given id is already running. The exception should be returned if no workflow with such id exists.\r\n",
