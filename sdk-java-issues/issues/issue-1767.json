  "body": "**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nToday `io.temporal.internal.testservice.CommandVerifier.verifyCommand` is called on each command to make sure valid or a task failure occurs. Since this is not a task failure caused by caller and there is no UI for Java test server, this is just silently failed. We should log (where it's called from `TestWorkflowMutableStateImpl`). This only applies to search attributes today, because that's the only thing we check command validity on (we don't need to log unhandled command, that's a normal state of operation).",
