## Housekeeping Summary

| Repository | Stale Issues | % of Open | Recommended Action |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| API | 13 | 100% | Review all issues; many may be outdated |
| Server | 374 | 70% | Triage ancient issues (218 are 3+ years old) |
| Java SDK | 156 | 72% | Close resolved test server issues |
| Go SDK | 101 | 62% | Review testing-related bugs |
| Features | 145 | 59% | Audit feature requests for relevance |
| .NET SDK | 24 | 49% | Healthy ratio; routine maintenance |
| Python SDK | 53 | 46% | Focus on sandbox-related issues |
| TypeScript SDK | 58 | 40% | Healthy ratio; address Jest issues |
| PHP SDK | 18 | 37% | Good health; continue current pace |
| Ruby SDK | 4 | 18% | Excellent health; minimal action needed |

**Total stale issues across all repos:** 946 (61% of open issues)

### Key Observations

1. **API repository** has 100% stale issues - needs complete review to determine relevance
2. **Server and Java SDK** have the oldest backlogs with 218 and 104 issues over 3 years old respectively
3. **Ruby and PHP SDKs** are well-maintained with low stale percentages
4. **Go and Java SDKs** are actively shrinking their backlogs (negative velocity)
5. **Server, TypeScript, Features, and Python** are seeing backlog growth

### Recommendations

1. Schedule quarterly triage sessions for repositories with >60% stale issues
2. Consider closing issues with no activity in 3+ years after community consultation
3. Tag stale issues requesting community interest to gauge ongoing relevance
4. Celebrate the Go and Java SDK teams for backlog reduction success
