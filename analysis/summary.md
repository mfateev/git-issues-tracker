## Recommended Initiatives

### 1. Test Framework Modernization

**Impact:** All SDKs, all users testing workflows
**Related Issues:**
- Java SDK [#1693](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1693) - listWorkflowExecutions
- Java SDK [#1804](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1804) - CLI server support
- Go SDK [#866](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/866), [#1282](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1282) - Timeout enforcement
- TypeScript SDK [#928](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/928) - Jest open handles
- Features [#649](https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/649) - Unit testing versioning

Consider a unified test server implementation that provides full feature parity with production.

### 2. OpenTelemetry v2 Migration

**Impact:** TypeScript, Python, Java SDK users; observability stack consistency
**Related Issues:**
- TypeScript SDK [#1658](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1658) - OTel v2 support
- TypeScript SDK [#1859](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1859), [#1860](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1860) - OTel performance
- Python SDK [#160](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/160) - Context detach errors
- Java SDK [#2394](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2394) - Pure OTel support

Coordinate OTel v2 upgrade across SDKs with performance testing.

### 3. Priority Queue Completion

**Impact:** Server users needing workflow prioritization
**Related Issues:**
- Server [#1507](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1507) - Priority task queues with fairness

Simple priority (1-5) shipped in v1.28.0; fairness and ordering features are in active development. Complete the fairness implementation to address the #2 most-upvoted request.

### 4. Alternative Database Backend Strategy

**Impact:** Users in cloud environments requiring specific databases
**Related Issues:**
- Server [#2318](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2318) - MongoDB
- Server [#5302](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5302) - YDB
- Server [#328](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/328) - Amazon Keyspaces
- Server [#3366](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3366) - SQLite production

Clarify roadmap for database support and community contribution paths.

### 5. Security Vulnerability Remediation

**Impact:** All production deployments
**Related Issues:**

## Housekeeping Summary

| Repository | Stale Issues | % of Open | Recommended Action |
|------------|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Server | 374 | 71% | Systematic triage; update issues with progress |
| Features | 145 | 59% | Expected for tracking repo; focus on high-upvote items |
| Java SDK | 156 | 72% | Close obsolete 2020-2021 issues; update test server roadmap |
| Go SDK | 102 | 63% | Triage 5+ year old issues; close obsolete items |
| TypeScript SDK | 58 | 40% | Best staleness rate; maintain current pace |
| Python SDK | 53 | 46% | Consolidate debugging and sandbox issues |
| .NET SDK | 24 | 48% | Close resolved test flake investigations |
| PHP SDK | 18 | 36% | Healthy backlog; address as capacity allows |
| Ruby SDK | 4 | 18% | Best staleness rate across all repos |
| API | 13 | 100% | All issues stale; triage for relevance |

**Total stale issues across all repos:** 947 (61% of open issues)

**Key housekeeping recommendations:**
1. **Update issue statuses** - Many issues have progress not reflected (e.g., Server [#1507](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1507) priority queues)
2. **Close or document workarounds** - Issues with Nexus-based solutions (e.g., Server [#680](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/680))
3. **Consolidate duplicates** - Test framework issues across repos often overlap
4. **Label consistently** - Apply "up-for-grabs" labels to enable community contributions
