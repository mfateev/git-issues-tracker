## 1. Critical: Testing Framework Issues (45+ issues)

The testing framework is the #1 pain point for Go SDK users. Issues span behavior discrepancies, missing features, and bugs.

### 1.1 Test Environment Behavior Discrepancies (15+ issues)

The `TestWorkflowEnvironment` behaves differently from production in critical ways:

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| [#1282](../repos/temporalio-sdk-go/issues.md#1282) | **Heartbeat timeout not raised** (5 👍) |
| [#866](../repos/temporalio-sdk-go/issues.md#866) | **WorkflowExecutionTimeout not enforced** (4 👍) |
| [#1496](../repos/temporalio-sdk-go/issues.md#1496) | Workflow outcome inconsistent between test env and real server |

### 6.2 Stale Issues (101 issues)

101 issues have had no activity in >12 months. Recommend:
1. Review each for current relevance
2. Request reproduction on current SDK version
3. Close if no response in 30 days

### 6.3 Issues to Consolidate

**Testing Framework Cluster:**
- Multiple test environment behavior issues could be addressed together
