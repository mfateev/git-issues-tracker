  "body": "When JUnit test timeouts (because a timeout was specified), the TestWorkflowRule prints out a diagnostic message that contains\r\nhistories of all workflows started by the test. This is useful, but misses a lot of useful information that could be used to troubleshoot a stuck test problem. \r\n\r\nSome of the potential additions:\r\n\r\n* Result of DescribeWorkflowExecution call for each workflow. Especially useful information about activities and workflow tasks in retry.\r\n* Stack trace query result for each open workflow.\r\n* I would also improve the formatting of the printed history",
