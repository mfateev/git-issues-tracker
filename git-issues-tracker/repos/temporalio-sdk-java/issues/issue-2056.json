  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently update handlers in Java are all run in their own threads. This means that if the update handler takes a long time and multiple updates are sent the workflow execution can consume lots of threads just waiting in update handlers. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSupport the ability to transform an update call into a `Promise` that can be completed later in another thread like the main workflow method .\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe have a similar feature to support async activities https://javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.0.6/io/temporal/activity/ActivityExecutionContext.html#isUseLocalManualCompletion--\r\n\r\nCurrently users can do this with the existing SDK API, but it will still consume a thread waiting for the result to return in the handle. If the SDK had a native API for this we wouldn't need to wait in the thread.",
