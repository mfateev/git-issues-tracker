  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently signaling a closed workflow will throw this exception, but there are several cases:\r\n* Workflow really doesn't exist (or deleted after retention)\r\n* Workflow is completed/terminated/etc (closed)\r\n\r\nAs an application, we sometimes need to handle the two cases differently(error handling). \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe exception should just return \"WorkflowStatus\" inside. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently we have to make a DescribeWorkflowExecution API call to achieve this. This requires more code, more error handling, and higher latency . \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n",
