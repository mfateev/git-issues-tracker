  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nExternal SDKs need to know when the test server is up and ready to use. Today SDKs just continually try to open a socket until it succeeds. Also, users might want to know also.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nCreate some kind of output (stdout or stderr) that is somewhat predictable (e.g. starts with a common string or something) and would be the _first_ output of the test server process when the server is successfully started and ready for use. This way an SDK can wait for the first bit of stdout or stderr to know whether something failed or server has started.",
