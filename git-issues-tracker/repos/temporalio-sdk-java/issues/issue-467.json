  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn the event of a refactor wherein activity names are changed (prefix added, method name changed, etc) there is no clean way to migrate from one activity name to another --> if a worker picks up an activity with a name that is not registered with that worker it will throw an `ApplicationFailure`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI would like to have the ability to register multiple activity names for an activity - this way one could deploy the activity name change and then on the next deploy delete the previous activity name.\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be a mechanism to mark one activity name as deprecated.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
