Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIf we hit WorkflowStub#getResultAsync and after that, we either don't wait on the result at all or wait for a bit and discard after, the long poll continues to run.\r\nThis creates a need for an unpleasant, unconventional `WorkflowStub#getResultAsync(resultType, timeout)`.\r\nWhy do users need to pass a timeout to `getResultAsync` if they pass it into `Future.get(timeout)`.\r\nMost users just use `WorkflowStub#getResultAsync(resultType)` not understanding that they create a leak if the workflows don't finish fast.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nInstead of that, Temporal Java SDK code should maintain a weak or phantom reference on the CompletableFuture that we return to the users and cancel the background long poll when it's discarded by the user code.",
