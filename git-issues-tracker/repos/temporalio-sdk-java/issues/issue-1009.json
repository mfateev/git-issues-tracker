  "body": "Temporal JavaSDK has an untyped `WorkflowStub` that is bound to a specific method invocation (workflow method), while a currently existing ActivityStub is bound to the AcitivityInterface and not to the specific activity type. \r\n\r\nThe source of the inconsistency is that one `WorkflowInterface` has always only one \"entry\" workflow method, while an ActivityInterface can have several `ActivityMethod`.\r\n\r\nTo keep things consistent, we should have a variation of the ActivityStub that binds an execution of the activity to a specific type the same way as WorkflowStub. There also should be an `ActivityStub.fromTyped` method working similarly with `WorkflowStub.fromTyped` (but probably taking a method reference instead of a pointer to an instance)\r\n\r\nThe current Activity stub that we have in JavaSDK looks like\r\n```\r\npublic interface ActivityStub {\r\n  <R> R execute(String activityName, Class<R> resultClass, Object... args);\r\n\r\n  <R> R execute(String activityName, Class<R> resultClass, Type resultType, Object... args);\r\n\r\n  <R> Promise<R> executeAsync(String activityName, Class<R> resultClass, Object... args);\r\n\r\n  <R> Promise<R> executeAsync(\r\n      String activityName, Class<R> resultClass, Type resultType, Object... args);\r\n}```\r\nwhich is inconsistent with WorkflowStub and makes it harder to work with untyped ActivityStubs.\r\n",
