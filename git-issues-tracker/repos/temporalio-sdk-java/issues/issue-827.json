  "body": "If dependency injection into the workflow is discouraged, we need to provide a way for an external code to pass all kinds of configurations into Workflow instances. A potential solution to ensure determinism could be implementing it on interceptors level and storing configuration into a (mutable?) side effect and providing a set of handy utility methods (Probably on `Workflow`) to access it in the workflow implementation.",
