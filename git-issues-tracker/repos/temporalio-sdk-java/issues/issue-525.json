  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI'm trying to access information from a context propagator in an Activity. The current strategy is that the context propagator should create a `ThreadLocal` to make this data accessible from an Activity, but the ergonomics of this could be improved.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nBeing able to access propagated context via `Activity.getExecutionContext()` would be have better ergonomics. In this scenario, it seems like the responsibility would still be on the `ContextPropagator` or interceptor to populate these values, but accessing this information from activities would be cleaner.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe existing `ThreadLocal` pattern works.\r\n",
