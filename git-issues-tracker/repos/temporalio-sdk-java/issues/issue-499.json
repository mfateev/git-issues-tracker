      "body": "Hey @mobiletoly, `TEMPORAL_DEBUG` is intended to be used to adjust certain timeouts so that when you stop in the debugger you don't affect workflow execution. Your proposal goes slightly against this idea as it would alter workflow behavior by changing how it handles the errors. I don't like this, as it could make certain tests pass/fail with or without the flag.",
