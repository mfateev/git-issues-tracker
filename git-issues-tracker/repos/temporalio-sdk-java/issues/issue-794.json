This is a good default behavior for these main completion counters, but we are lacking any reporting of replays counters.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nReplay metrics could be important for detecting the anomaly behavior of the system. We should discuss how do we want to report replays metric. \r\n- Do we want to report them by status codes? \r\n- Do we want to just report a total number of replays? \r\n- Only full replays or partial too?\r\n",
