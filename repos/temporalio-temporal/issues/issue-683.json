There are many dynamic config knobs exposed by the system so operators can tune them for their specific needs.  Most basic one is service [rps](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/service/frontend/service.go#L66) to protect Temporal service to get overwhelmed by single namespace.  Another system wide dynamic config knob is [PersistenceMaxQPS](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/service/frontend/service.go#L57) which serves to protect database from getting overwhelmed by the service.  \r\nDo you have a specific back pressure use case in mind?
