Please describe.**\r\nMigrating to ipv6 is hard but will (probably?) eventually happen. To make this transition easier for operators, it would be advantageous for operators to be able to use either/both ipv4 and ipv6 to connect to temporal server services at the same time.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nwhen starting temporal server services, by default, if an external ipv4 and ipv6 address are available, bind to both using the same port.\r\n\r\nAlter services rpc config `BindOnLocalHost` to bind on both `127.0.0.1` and `::1` if both are available.\r\n\r\nAdd some method to services rpc config to allow specifying multiple IPs to bind to (could be one v4 and one v6, or just N addresses to support multihomed environments).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIt may be possible to run multiple of the same service on a host with both IPv4 and IPv6, one bound to IPv4 and one bound to IPv6, though that would probably be more resource intensive than enabling one process listening on multiple addresses.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-08-09T16:20:19Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4749,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support listening on both IPv4 and IPv6 networks in dual stack environments","updatedAt":"2023-08-09T16:20:19Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4749"}
