Please describe.**\nSignal requestID is for dedupping signal request.

If that's the case, we can persist the requestID as part of the signaled event, so that upon reset, the signal requestID map can be rebuilt.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n* We don't have to do it if we believe we won't benefit much from making this change. \n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-03-08T02:15:00Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5OTA0OTIw","name":"discussion","description":"","color":"3ffcb0"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTM4ODI4MTE3","name":"up-for-grabs","description":"Issues to consider for external contribution","color":"69CD90"}],"milestone":null,"number":4029,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Clear signal requestID on workflow close","updatedAt":"2023-03-10T22:50:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4029"}
