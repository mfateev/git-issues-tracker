Please describe.**\r\nI'm thinking of adopting temporal in my current system for decoupling durable complex tasks from microservices, which should implement only atomic functionalities I assume. However, the microservices are cross clusters therefore behind their firewalls. And, Temporal only supports gRPC so I don't know how friendly it is to the firewalls.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI need a firewall-friendly solution of orchestrating durable tasks. e.g. Maybe agents are needed to be deployed in each clusters/vnets communicating with the orchestrator as control plane. So any suggestions from temporal perspective?\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nDIY by using gocelery or machinery to implement the whole solution.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThanks.","closedAt":"2023-10-21T20:07:24Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5c_AQt","author":{"login":"mfateev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Temporal workers which are hosted inside each service only need an outbound gRPC connection to the Temporal service.
