Please describe.**\r\nCore Temporal components connect to each other over a gRPC connection configured within the Temporal server codebase. An individual instance of Temporal Server does not have access to and cannot configure the underlying connection. \r\n\r\nWithout the ability to configure/intercept that connection when a Temporal server component is started, we cannot add things like custom tracing or `grpc.WithPerRPCCredentials.`\r\n\r\n These are necessary so we can properly identify services when they reach out Temporal frontend\r\n \r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTemporal server components would expose access to their underlying gRPC connection during initialization. A user can set custom dial options and/or interceptors on the underlying connection. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs far as I've been able to tell, no implementation exists in Temporal Server for this level of control.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-05-26T15:10:15Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2905,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Access and configure underlying gRPC connection for core components","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:20:16Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2905"}
