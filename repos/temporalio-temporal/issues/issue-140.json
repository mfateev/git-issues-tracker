Here is the buildkite [before](https://buildkite.com/temporal/temporal-server/builds/272) and [after](https://buildkite.com/temporal/temporal-server/builds/273) the revert.\r\n\r\nWe're unfortunately using a quite old version of gocql, so I need to investigate further on what the behavioral difference is and if there are any release notes or published changes in the past 3 years in this area.
