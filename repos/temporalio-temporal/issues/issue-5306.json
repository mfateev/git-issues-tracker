Please describe.**\r\nWe have a policy of using only STANDARD_IA storage class. Currently, there is no ability to specify the storage class to use in S3 Archival configurations. This is blocking us from using S3 archival.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSupport additional S3 connection \"kwargs\" which will all just be passed to the connection or add `storage_class` as an option.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe are considering using filestore archival instead. Either that or implementing our own archiver.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-17T10:01:33Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5306,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Defining a storage class on S3 archival","updatedAt":"2024-01-17T10:01:33Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5306"}
