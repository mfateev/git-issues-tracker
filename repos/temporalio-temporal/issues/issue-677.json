Please describe.**\r\nTemporal writes event to historystore in a batch which can be of variable sizes.  When we query \r\nfor a page of event we set the page size based on number of batches we read from database.\r\nThis could be a problem if user is writing very large payloads and single batch is large in size.\r\nWe may end of loading unnecessary events which we have to throw away when returning the \r\nevents back to client based on the page size set by the caller. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe need to design a solution which allows us to load events based on size rather than count.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAnother alternate is to still load on count but have throttling in place using size of payloads \r\nloaded from DB.
