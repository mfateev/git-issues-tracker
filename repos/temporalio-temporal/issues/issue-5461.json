Please describe.**\r\nWhen using the repo as a library, as in the cli, there's no good way (that I could find) to extract the bound metrics port if you pass in `0` in the config. This makes it hard to figure out (log, in my case) what port was actually chosen. I had to find a free port first to work around that, even though the code would do that for me.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nHave some easy way to fetch the chosen metrics port after instantiating / starting a dev server\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-28T17:30:40Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5461,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add programmatic way to extract metrics port when passing `0` in config","updatedAt":"2024-02-28T17:30:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5461"}
