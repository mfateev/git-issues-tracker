Please describe.**\r\n\r\nToday dynamic config supports converting config values from primitive types and collections to other Go types.\r\nThe conversion code is run every time a value is retrieved and could end up taking up excessive CPU resources.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPerform conversion only when values change. Based on discussions with @dnr, the best way to achieve this is to optimize for `NotifyingClient` implementations (an optional interface for `Client`).\r\nThe concern with this approach is that we would end up with two code paths to maintain and that users that provide an alternative `Client` implementation would not get the perf benefits. We should be careful if we decide to change the `Client` interface since it's public and we try not to break API compatibility.","closedAt":"2025-08-08T15:33:00Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-11-05T18:47:35Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6756,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Optimize dynamic config value conversion","updatedAt":"2025-08-08T15:33:00Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6756"}
