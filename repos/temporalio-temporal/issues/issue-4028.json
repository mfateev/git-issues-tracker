Change tctl code to include a requestID when sending signals\n1. Start a workflow\n1. Use the modified tctl to signal it several time.\n1. Terminate the workflow started in 2\n1. Run `tctl admin desc` command, `signalRequestedIds` field is shown.\n1. Reset the workflow to first workflow task (any reset type will do I think, but I haven't verified)\n1. Run `tctl admin desc` command for the new run, there's no `signalRequestedIds` field.\n\n## Specifications\n* Version: master\n* Platform:\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-03-08T02:10:31Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":4028,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Signal requestID dropped upon workflow reset","updatedAt":"2023-08-10T22:25:28Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4028"}
