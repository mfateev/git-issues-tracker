Please describe.**\r\nIt is very hard to discover how to export a workflow history in JSON format. It is not found anywhere in tctl help. You have to specify `--output_filename` parameter in `workflow show` command. And the file will contain JSON.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nExplicit flag that specifies output format. I would replace `--print_full` flag with `--outuput_format` that can be `short`, `full`, `json`, etc.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2021-07-07T15:08:24Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4ODE0NzY0NA==","author":{"login":"GreyTeardrop"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I really like this idea.
