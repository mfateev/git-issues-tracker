The \"localhost\" version was using `temporal server start-dev` (v1.25) and the \"cloud\" variant was using cloud namespace `sdk-ci.a2dd6.tmprl.cloud` (also in `us-west-2`). The latency measured is from sending an update to receiving the result. Go SDK. The update handler mutates local workflow state but does not block on anything. The experiments send n=2000 updates since this is the maximum allowed per workflow.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, neither signal latency nor query latency show the same trend:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"365\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/616ab490-3d8b-44dc-8e01-fd0534056e84\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"359\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5901ba8-6779-4166-85fc-47adc1331726\">\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-09-12T21:27:37Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":6512,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Update latency increases with number of updates sent to workflow","updatedAt":"2024-09-12T22:16:00Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6512"}
