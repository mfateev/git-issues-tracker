Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen writing a long-running Workflow, I'd like to know when to Continue As New.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI'd like to have SDKs provide both of these to Workflows: \r\n\r\n- `eventHistoryLength` (https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-features/issues/16)\r\n- `shouldContinueAsNew`\r\n\r\nThe former is the last event ID. The latter can either be:\r\n\r\n1. Set by the SDK: for instance `shouldContinueAsNew = eventHistoryLength > 10_000`\r\n2. Communicated by the Server (in an event header?). This might be preferable, as the Server has more knowledge—for example, it might be able to keep a running total size of a Workflow's Event History, and set `shouldContinueAsNew=true` before 10k events if the Payloads are large. And maybe @mfateev had other reasons for suggesting this route?\r\n\r\n> We should give `Workflow.isContinueAsNewNeeded` flag to the SDKs. And it should be coming from the service.\r\n\r\nhttps://temporaltechnologies.slack.com/archives/C01FT8U10GK/p1643400086752909?thread_ts=1643398281.925129&cid=C01FT8U10GK\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2023-02-09T20:24:54Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-04-14T05:01:44Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2726,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Communicate shouldContinueAsNew to Workers ","updatedAt":"2023-02-09T20:24:54Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2726"}
