Please describe.**\nCurrently, timers created in Temporal workflows are assigned system-generated IDs (UUIDs) which are not human-readable. This makes debugging, monitoring, and managing workflows harder, especially when multiple timers are involved. For example, in the Temporal Web UI, timers appear only with generic IDs, making it difficult to identify their purpose at a glance.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nIt would be very helpful to have an option to assign custom, descriptive names or labels to timers when creating them via the SDK (e.g., Workflow.newTimer(Duration, String timerName)). These names would then be visible in the Temporal Web UI and logs, improving workflow observability and troubleshooting.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n-     Using custom search attributes or workflow metadata to tag timers indirectly.\n-     Adding logging messages with timer names during workflow execution.\n-     Naming workflows or task queues meaningfully to partially compensate.\n\nHowever, these alternatives do not solve the core issue of timers lacking explicit, human-readable names in the system.\n\n**Additional context**\n<img width=\"790\" height=\"126\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bc82ece-2e33-4d6c-bbab-e68be2495f59\" />\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-29T10:13:05Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":8109,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support for Naming Timers in Temporal Workflows","updatedAt":"2025-07-29T10:13:05Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8109"}
