This `--version` flag is inherited by default from https://github.com/urfave/cli/tree/main (the package that the tool uses to standardize the UX for CLIs).\n\nThis is where the value for the temporal-sql-tool version is set: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/c762ad2ee285fda23497af32a8c0fb7988239b81/tools/sql/main.go#L36\n\nSimilarly, this is where the value for the temporal-cassandra-tool version is set: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/c762ad2ee285fda23497af32a8c0fb7988239b81/tools/cassandra/main.go#L36\n\nNote: since the variable is set within a function's scope, it is not possible to use `go build -ldflags \"-X 'some_package.Version=1.2.3'\" ./cmd/tools/sql` to set a version for the tool when compiling it with `go`.\n\nAdditionally, this raises a bigger question of how the `temporal-sql-tool` and `temporal-cassandra-tool` should be versioned (should they be versioned in step with the `temporal-server`? or should the versioning of these tools be incremented independently - if so, how to properly and easily allow one to inspect the precise code branch for a given version of the tool?)\n\n## Actual Behavior\nThe `--version` flag outputs a meaningful and correct version.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n  1. docker run -it temporalio/admin-tools bash\n  2. $ temporal-sql-tool --version\n  3. $ temporal-cassandra-tool --version\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: n/a\n  - Platform: linux (ubuntu)","closedAt":"2025-07-14T20:39:33Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM62WiVa","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Good point.\nWe should make sure we properly set the versions when we build these tools.\nWe will likely fold these tools into `tdbg` sub commands instead of maintaining separate binaries.","createdAt":"2025-07-10T22:38:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7992#issuecomment-3059361114","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-07-01T19:13:03Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":7992,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Lack of versioning for temporal-sql-tool and temporal-cassandra-tool","updatedAt":"2025-07-14T20:39:33Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7992"}
