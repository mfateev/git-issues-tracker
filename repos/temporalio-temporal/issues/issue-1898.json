Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI'd like to run the Temporal server process as a daemon locally and it would be useful if the server could write its PID to a file.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI imagine it working as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Specify path to the pid file in the configuration\r\n2. The server writes its PID on start\r\n3. The server deletes the PID file on shutdown\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI could also implement this myself with another tool, but it would be convenient if it was built-in.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nWe don't use Docker for local development but rather run dependent servers as processes directly, so now I have to figure out some daemonization process myself. I'm trying to figure out if there's a way in which Temporal server could make this easier.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM42qbz7","author":{"login":"dnr"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Can you use systemd or another process manager that doesn't use pid files? Pid files are a really archaic mechanism and prone to race conditions and other issues. Note that even if there's a pid file, Go binaries like the Temporal server are never going to support forking into the background like classic daemons, so you're going to want to run them under a process manager anyway.","createdAt":"2021-09-10T17:47:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1898#issuecomment-917093627","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-09-08T09:10:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1898,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add pid file configuration option","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:21:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1898"}
