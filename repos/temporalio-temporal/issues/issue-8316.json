I know it might take extra care such as using a local docker registry, or a version control system, or a local software package publishing system. But how does Temporal know the version of the code which it is running? Do we have an API to annotate this in a custom way, and possibly orchestrate rollback operation?","closedAt":"2025-10-30T22:37:11Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7IfIaE","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"You should check out our worker versioning and deployment APIs: https://docs.temporal.io/production-deployment/worker-deployments/worker-versioning\n\nLet me know if this is not what you wanted, or I will close the issue in a week or two.","createdAt":"2025-10-02T23:27:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8316#issuecomment-3363604100","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7O26cl","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing due to no response from the OP.","createdAt":"2025-10-30T22:37:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8316#issuecomment-3470501669","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-09-12T00:22:57Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":8316,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Version control in activity code or worker","updatedAt":"2025-10-30T22:37:11Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8316"}
