Enable default authorizer and claim mapper and start Temporal\r\n  2. Start new Temporal UI with enabled auth (via OpenID Connect)\r\n  3. Configure your IDP to include \"permissions\": [\"system:read\"] claim to your access token.\r\n  4. Open Temporal UI and try to navigate to any workflow details.\r\nActual: the UI shows an error and then redirects the user to the login screen. The root cause is that the UI tries to use the GetWorkflowExecutionHistoryReverse API but the default authorizer rejects this request because this API is not included into the readonlyNamespaceAPI map (and the permissions claim is system:read)\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: Temporal Server 1.17.5, Temporal UI 2.5.1\r\n  - Platform:\r\n","closedAt":"2022-09-23T16:58:32Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5KrAo9","author":{"login":"MichaelSnowden"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It looks like this was already fixed by https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/commit/c5ccbd5963bc280163eff2aed798b2e060b8334c .
