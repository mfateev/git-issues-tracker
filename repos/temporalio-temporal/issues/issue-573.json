Please describe.**\r\nCurrently Temporal forces a user to pass in a timeout when starting a workflow execution.  Recently instead of user provided timeout we defined a default on the server.  Default value for server config knob is 10 years.  This is a problem as previously this timeout was treated as catch all to cleanup all resources associated within the system.  This could introduce a potential scalability bottleneck in the system as we will be creating this additional timer for each workflow execution and in most circumstances this is not even used for short lived workflows.  This just results in accumulating all those timers in the database.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIntroduce a concept of infinite timer and switch the server default for workflow execution/run timeout to be infinite.  Meaning we do not create any workflow timeout task in this situation.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n","closedAt":"2021-01-28T00:31:32Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-07-20T22:57:45Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":573,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Introduce a concept of infinite timeout","updatedAt":"2021-01-28T00:31:32Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/573"}
