That means that the cronjob does not exist anymore at this point.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n  1. Create Temporal cronjob (Which always fails)\n  2. Check if the next Temporal cronjob run is scheduled\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: 1.27.2\n  - Platform: Java\n","closedAt":"2025-09-30T12:38:34Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7CFAhv","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Can you provide more information please?\n\n1.
