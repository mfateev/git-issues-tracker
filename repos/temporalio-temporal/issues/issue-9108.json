Please describe.**\nWe experienced an issue where we couldn't view schedules via UI due to Namespace Persistence Max QPS Reached errors. This happened when tuning global persistence QPS per namespace.\n\nRoot cause: A single DescribeSchedule request can generate 5-20+ persistence calls (GetCurrentExecution, GetWorkflowExecution, ReadHistoryBranch, etc.) in a burst. This number increases based on recent/running workflows in the schedule. These are mostly read operations, which are less costly than writes. But with a single combined QPS limit, it's easy to hit the limit quickly - especially on smaller DB sizes or when workflows are concentrated on a single pod.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nSeparate read and write QPS limits:\n```\nhistory.persistenceNamespaceReadMaxQPS: 500\nhistory.persistenceNamespaceWriteMaxQPS: 100\n```\n\nThis would allow read-heavy operations (like Schedule APIs, UI browsing) to work without risking DB overload from writes.\n\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAs of now, we have increased the namespace QPS quota to accommodate schedules\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2026-01-22T01:10:32Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":9108,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Separate Read and Write QPS Limits for Persistence","updatedAt":"2026-01-22T01:10:54Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/9108"}
