Please describe.**\r\nQuerying for workflow state (strong consistency) results in a error: \r\n```cluster or namespace does not enable strongly consistent query but strongly consistent query was requested```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt appears that the dynamic config variable (history.EnableConsistentQueryByNamespace: true) would fix it. Can we make the default as true? I added the dynamic config and it started working (with a latency). \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt's likely that this might increase the latency. Open to feedback. \r\n\r\nP.S The docs related to this would need an update - https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go-queries. Some notes look outdated (like the valid arguments for a \"query_type\"). \r\n","closedAt":"2020-07-14T19:11:48Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODM2MTQzOQ==","author":{"login":"alexshtin"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Query consistency level was completely removed together with dynamic config settings: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/468.
