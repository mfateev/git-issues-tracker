If you create a schedule and specify \"every 365 days\" the result will be that the first run is on `2024-12-18 00:00:00`. **That's in 6 months**. I've tried passing `StartAt: 2025-06-19` but I get `2025-12-18 00:00:00` as a result.\r\n\r\nI understand this may be known and as-designed behavior but it struck me as unexpected to ask for a 365 day interval, yet the first run is within the next 6 months.\r\n\r\nI also don't see any way to achieve my desired result. Am I missing anything?\r\n\r\n_EDIT_: I also can't use the _offset_ to control this behavior because I don't know what the final calculation will be until the schedule is created.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIn the example above, I'd prefer to have the schedule's first run be at my specified \"StartAt\". So, if I say:\r\n\r\n\"Start this workflow every 365 days with start at 2025-02-03 04:05:06\", then the upcoming runs would look like:\r\n\r\n* 2025-02-03 04:05:06\r\n* 2026-02-03 04:05:06\r\n* 2027-02-03 04:05:06\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I pick 365 days as the interval, I seem to be getting a date 6 months in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Go to temporal UI and add a schedule.\r\n  1. Choose 365 days and save.\r\n  1. Check the schedule's upcoming runs.\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version:\r\n  - Platform:\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-06-19T17:59:22Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":6173,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Schedule \"StartAt\" not used when calculating intervals?","updatedAt":"2024-06-21T20:04:47Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6173"}
