Please describe.**\nThe new (currently lowest) priority `CallerTypePreemptable` should be used for all replication and all queues other than transfer/timer/visibility to resolve issues of resource contention noticed during namespace migration.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nRight now task executable assumes all tasks are background, we need a ways to specify different caller type for different task categories. Same for the implementation on task loading.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n\n**Additional context**\nFollowup to https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/3870\n\n","closedAt":"2023-10-22T01:43:12Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5pvJNW","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"done","createdAt":"2023-10-22T01:43:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3874#issuecomment-1773966166","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-01-31T19:25:39Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3874,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Use new CallerTypePreemptable for all queues other than transfer/timer/visibility","updatedAt":"2023-10-22T01:43:12Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3874"}
