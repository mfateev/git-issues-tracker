Please describe.**\r\nI'm trying to use the [MeterProvider](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric@v0.33.0#MeterProvider) introduced in v0.32.0 for the otel metrics sdk, but my project imports Temporal which uses v0.31.0. This causes a dependency conflict because the newer versions deprecate some folders and I can't use the new version of the sdk.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI wanted to request to keep the OTel dependencies in sync, or upgraded to v0.32.0 if v0.33.0 causes breaking changes.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSeems to be the same problem described in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2321\r\n","closedAt":"2023-03-13T16:37:54Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5Nvbf9","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The v0.32 upgrade removes the ability to specify custom histogram buckets boundaries.
