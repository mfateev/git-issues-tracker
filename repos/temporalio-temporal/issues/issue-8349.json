Please describe.**\nRight now querying workflows requires absolute timestamps, which is frustrating when I want to quickly search based on relative time. I want to be able to find workflows started in the last hour without needing to figure out the absolute timestamp myself before sending the query.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI'd like to be able to query with < '5m' or >= '1 day' where it's a relative time and the absolute timestamp is calculated at the time of query execution.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7LYNeA","author":{"login":"awln-temporal"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Feature implementation requires a signed Duration value to compare with the current timestamp.
