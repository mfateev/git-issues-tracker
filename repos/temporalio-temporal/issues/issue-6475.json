Basically something like `go.temporal.io/server/temporal.WithSearchAttributes` that accepts a `map[string]enums.IndexedValueType` (or any other structure) and does not start the server until those are confirmed set with that value type. I think the best way is to register if attr name not there, do nothing if attr name there and the proper type, and fail startup if attr there but wrong type. It's possible this can be used for general server config too.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-09-03T21:42:23Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6475,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support registering search attributes as an option/config","updatedAt":"2024-09-03T21:42:23Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6475"}
