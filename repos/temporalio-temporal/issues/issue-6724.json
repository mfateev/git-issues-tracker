Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently only batch reset to first workflow task is useful. In many cases, reset to last workflow task will just complete or fail the workflow. If the activity task fail and we wanted to reset, we should reset to last workflow task -1. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nProvide more reset types, maybe an offset based on the workflow first/last workflow task. Or by time\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNA.
