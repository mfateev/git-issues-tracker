A lot of the time this will be populated with the same value as `run_id`.\n\nToday, when SDK gets `StartWorkflowExecutionResponse` with `started` as `false` or `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedFailure`, it doesn't include the first execution run ID that we can bind successive calls to. It only provides the run ID. If you start a workflow today successfully, SDK uses the run ID as the first execution run ID on successive calls like cancel and signal and such. But if you start a workflow today w/ conflict policy of use existing and it doesn't start, that run ID is not acceptable for first execution run ID.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7O3Jse","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It's a bit involved but not too much of a heavy lift, there's some information that we don't have at the time when we handle the request that we would need to store in the current run persistence record.","createdAt":"2025-10-30T22:50:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8537#issuecomment-3470564126","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-10-24T14:59:28Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":8537,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add first execution run ID for already-started start workflow results","updatedAt":"2025-10-30T22:50:39Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8537"}
