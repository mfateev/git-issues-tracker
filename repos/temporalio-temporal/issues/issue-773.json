However, the activities in child workflow are not bound to be executed in the same worker. Is the session data lost when transferring ctx to the new childworkflow? Should I pass the session taskQueue to the child workflow and reset ctx whit it?\r\nThank you","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MzUzNjM1MQ==","author":{"login":"samarabbas"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@mfateev any thoughts on this one?","createdAt":"2021-07-04T07:15:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/773#issuecomment-873536351","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MzYyNzc5Nw==","author":{"login":"mfateev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It is possible to reopen a session through [RecreateSession](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/9778ef5e148d747e953dc88a8dd654d6074ad417/workflow/session.go#L114).

One variation of such design is to have a session keeper workflow that other workflows use to request activity executions through signals.","createdAt":"2021-07-04T17:13:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/773#issuecomment-873627797","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2020-09-28T11:51:34Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":773,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"session and childworkflow","updatedAt":"2021-07-04T18:21:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/773"}
