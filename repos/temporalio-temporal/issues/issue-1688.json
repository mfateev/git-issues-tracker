It seems like this categorization of APINames into ReadOnly/ReadWrite/Admin categories should be done in the stock OSS code.\r\n\r\nIf there was such a built-in categorization available, then the default authorizer could use it to enforce the ReadOnly role. That's what I mean by out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\nFor the UI aspect of it, presumably the UI would need access to the `authorization.Claims` returned by the ClaimMapper for the logged in user.","closedAt":"2021-07-08T19:57:36Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-06-24T21:46:17Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDAxNDk5NzYw","name":"operations","description":"","color":"f9d0c4"}],"milestone":null,"number":1688,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add out-of-the-box support for read-only role","updatedAt":"2021-07-08T19:57:36Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1688"}
