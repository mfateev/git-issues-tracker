Please describe.**\r\nToday, Temporal Server loads TLS certificates upon startup and never updates them. To rotate a certificate before it expires, one has to update the configuration or the certificate file and then restart the server. This is at least a nuisance even with rolling restart of servers in a cluster. Such a rolling restart leads to reallocation of shards and increased latency in the process.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nServer needs to support rotation of certificates that doesn't require a restart.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nRolling restart as described above.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt would be even better for server to support pairs of active certificates (blue/green) that would allow to rotate only one certificate in a pair at a time.\r\n","closedAt":"2021-04-30T01:24:47Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTczMzQyNA==","author":{"login":"sergeybykov"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Resolved via #1415","createdAt":"2021-04-30T01:24:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1162#issuecomment-829733424","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-01-07T02:23:51Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1162,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add support for rotation of TLS certificates","updatedAt":"2021-04-30T01:24:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1162"}
