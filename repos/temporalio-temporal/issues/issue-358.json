Error : Request on table temporal.tasks with ttl of 630720000 seconds exceeds maximum supported expiration date of 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00. In order to avoid this use a lower TTL, change the expiration date overflow policy or upgrade to a version where this limitation is fixed. See CASSANDRA-14092 for more details.\",\r\n\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is only true when using Temporal with Cassandra and is due to a Cassandra limitation regarding TTL. Temporal could solve this problem for end users by explicitly allowing an infinite timeout when running workflows. I quoted my own explanation of the issue from Slack to give more context:\r\n\r\n> As the output states, it's possible to adjust the Cassandra overflow policy, but that actually doesn't effect this limitation. The policy can be changed to:\r\n \r\n> 1. reject TTLs that would overflow past 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00\r\n> 2. truncate TTLs that overflow to a max of 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 and warn the user\r\n> 3. truncate TTLs that overflow to a max of 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 and suppress a warning to the user\r\n \r\n> AFAIK it's not possible to actually have a TTL that ends after 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00","closedAt":"2020-12-15T02:24:07Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0NTAwOTU5Ng==","author":{"login":"wxing1292"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"v1.4.1 solved this issue","createdAt":"2020-12-15T02:24:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/358#issuecomment-745009596","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-05-07T21:26:15Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5NzgzNzUw","name":"API","description":"Issues/features involving the API","color":"3d910f"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ0NjY3ODQy","name":"cassandra","description":"","color":"dd4baf"}],"milestone":null,"number":358,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support explicit infinite timeout for workflows","updatedAt":"2020-12-15T02:24:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/358"}
