Many mocks are not used and can be safely removed.\r\n2. It is better to place mocks to separate package (`mocks` sub-dir for example). Reason: `mockgen` builds entire package to generate mocks, and if old incompatible mocks are left there, it just can't build the package and regenerate mocks. Old mocks can be deleted first but this can lead to the state when there are no mocks at all, if build fails because of some code errors.","closedAt":"2021-04-29T22:50:18Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTY0NTE5MQ==","author":{"login":"alexshtin"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"All mocks are converted to `mockgen` and checked into the repo.
