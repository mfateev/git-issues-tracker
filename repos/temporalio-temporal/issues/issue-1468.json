Please describe.**\r\nThe ActivityTaskStarted event is added to the history only after an activity is completed to avoid polluting history on activity retries. This is confusing especially when the retries are turned off by setting `RetryOptions.maximumAttempts` to 1.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd `ActivityTaskStarted` immediately to the history if retries are disabled by setting `RetryOptions.maximumAttempts` to 1.\r\n\r\nConsider adding `ActivityTaskStarted` immediately for the first attempt even if the activity has a retry options with non 1 maximumAttempts. In case of failure write ActivityTaskFailed only for the first attempt and then continue with the current logic. I would also add some field to ActivityTaskFailed/TimedOut that indicates that retries are going to happen.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMake UI only changes to surface that activity is in retry.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMTY1OTMzNw==","author":{"login":"feedmeapples"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Started showing Pending activities as Activity Task Started history event.
