With workflows and activities defined in code, ensuring determinism and correct execution across retries and failure recovery is critical. As the Temporal codebase evolves—including the core service, SDKs, and samples—changes to workflow execution semantics, scheduling, and state management can have far-reaching effects. Reviewing pull requests to understand which components and workflows are impacted often requires manually reading diffs and tracing through code to see how a change could affect workflow routing, history, persistence, and visibility.\n\nI’m building Hikaflow, an AI-powered engineering assistant that integrates with GitHub to help teams manage these complexities. Hikaflow provides:\n\n- On-demand code expertise: ask questions about Temporal’s codebase, modules, dependencies, and recent changes in scoped threads.\n- Auto commit summaries: structured summaries for each commit, highlighting features, dependency updates, refactors, and infra changes.\n- Issue detection: automatic scanning for security vulnerabilities, code smells, duplication, and complexity, with options to ignore or disable rules.\n- Auto pull request analysis: PR dashboard with summaries, contributor insights, complexity metrics, and AI-generated comments and prompts for fixes.\n- Contributor analytics: performance and quality dashboards across team members.\n- Impact analysis: maps changed files to workflows, activities, persistence layers, and core services, assigning risk levels to each impacted flow and generating targeted test cases.\n- Intelligent documentation: automatically generates and maintains documentation and diagrams for workflow and activity flows, APIs, and architectural components.\n- Full-code audits and engineering intelligence: scans entire repositories for issues, provides metrics on review latency and churn.\n- Seamless integration: runs as a GitHub app with no changes to your workflow.\n\nI’d love to offer a two-week trial of Hikaflow on Temporal to see if these features can help streamline PR reviews, surface regressions early, and improve release confidence. Let me know if you’re interested or have specific pain points that Hikaflow could address.\n\n— Romir","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-12-20T08:03:21Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":8889,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Enhancing Temporal PR Review and Release Confidence with Hikaflow","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T08:03:21Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8889"}
