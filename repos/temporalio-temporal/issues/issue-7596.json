After enabling Nexus we could not get the workflow to start in the target namespace.\n\nUpon further inspection we found that `/temporal.api.nexusservice.v1.NexusService/DispatchByEndpoint` is executed which is not listed in [metadata.go](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/v1.27.2/common/api/metadata.go). We rely on the Method Metadata and the functions defined in that file for our custom authorizer but since the DispatchByEndpoint is not part of any of the listings it was failing. DispatchByEndpoint seems crucial as it dispatches the request to the Endpoint I believe. \n\nIs this intentional, shouldn't they be part of the metadata file such as the DispatchNexusTask, PollNexusTaskQueue etc. apis?\n\n","closedAt":"2025-04-18T04:08:44Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6nvgcF","author":{"login":"rodrigozhou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thank you for reporting the issue.
