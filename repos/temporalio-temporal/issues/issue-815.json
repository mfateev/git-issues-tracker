Please describe.**\r\nDebugging TLS can be tough - it's nice to be able to test that TLS is working (connections being made, encryption happening) independently from making sure server name matches the cert or that the cert is signed by a trusted CA.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nPlease add a command line option for `tctl` to enable `InsecureSkipVerify` for dev/test/debug purposes.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIt may also be useful deploy a development cluster where tls clients use `InsecureSkipVerify` and tls servers use `RequireAnyClientCert` in order to test/debug `internode` and `frontend` mTLS.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis came up in looking at #812 as we default to connecting to localhost if no address is provided for development. Disabling host name or cert validation can assist in testing/debugging a TLS setup.","closedAt":"2021-04-30T02:26:37Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTc1MjU2NQ==","author":{"login":"underrun"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"fixed in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/1478 ","createdAt":"2021-04-30T02:26:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/815#issuecomment-829752565","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-10-08T17:19:47Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":815,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"allow disabling hostname/cert verification when connecting with TLS/mTLS","updatedAt":"2021-04-30T02:26:37Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/815"}
