Please describe.**\r\nCurrently workflows are hard to easily extend when adding new activities calls without any meaningful activity result for the workflow. This is because a workflow needs to be deterministic thus adding/removing activities will break determinism. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe would like to have an ability to mark an activity call as \"optional\", meaning that if we add or remove activity invocation from a workflow the workflow replay wont cause any determinism issue. This is only possible when the workflow is not depending on the result of the activity. This is especially useful when you have fire&forget kind of activities (like publishing messages, notifying other services, fan-outs, etc).\r\n\r\nAn potential example could be:\r\n```ts\r\nconst activitiesFn = [\r\n   (payload: string) => activityA(payload),\r\n   (payload: string) => activityB(payload),\r\n   (payload: string) => activityC(payload),\r\n   // possibility to just add additional activityFn without breaking determinism\r\n   // (payload: string) => activityD(payload),\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport async function activitiesWorkflow() {\r\n  const someEvent = 'abc';\r\n  await Promise.all(activitiesFn.map((fn) => fn(someEvent)));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nPublishing an single event and create own listeners which listen to the published event and react upon. This however requires own infra/queue/listeners setup to do fanout. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSlack: https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTRCR8RBP/p1725981611435449\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-09-15T07:49:44Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6521,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Optional Activities","updatedAt":"2024-09-15T07:50:11Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6521"}
