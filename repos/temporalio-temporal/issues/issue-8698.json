We are requesting confirmation on whether Temporal is impacted, and if any patches or mitigations are already planned or required.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 List of CVEs\n\n| CVE ID | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| **CVE-2025-47912** | `Parse()` incorrectly allows non-IPv6 values inside square brackets in URL host (RFC 3986 violation). |\n| **CVE-2025-58185** | Malicious DER payloads may allocate excessive memory, leading to memory exhaustion. |\n| **CVE-2025-58186** | Unlimited cookie parsing may result in high memory usage when many small cookies are sent. |\n| **CVE-2025-58187** | Name constraint checking scales non-linearly with certificate size → potential performance issue. |\n| **CVE-2025-58188** | DSA-based certificate validation may cause program panic due to unsafe interface casting. |\n| **CVE-2025-58189** | `Conn.Handshake` may leak attacker-controlled ALPN protocol values without escaping. |\n| **CVE-2025-61724** | `Reader.ReadResponse()` uses repeated string concatenation, leading to high CPU usage. |\n| **CVE-2025-61725** | `ParseAddress()` repeatedly concatenates domain literals, causing CPU performance impact. |\n\n---\n\n### 🧪 Suggested Code Areas to Review\n\nThe **installed version is `1.25.0`**, and as per the patch advisory, it should be **upgraded to `1.25.3`** to address the issue.\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7cTfaW","author":{"login":"shriacquia"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"New CVEs identified:\n<google-sheets-html-origin><style type=\"text/css\"><!--td {border: 1px solid #cccccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}--></style>\nCVE ID | CVSS Severity\n-- | --\nCVE-2025-47910 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-47912 | HIGH\nCVE-2025-47914 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-58181 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-58183 | LOW\nCVE-2025-58185 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-58186 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-58187 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-58188 | HIGH\nCVE-2025-58189 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-61723 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-61724 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-61725 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-61727 | MEDIUM\nCVE-2025-61729 | MEDIUM\n\n","createdAt":"2025-12-29T10:26:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8698#issuecomment-3696096918","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-11-25T12:26:43Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":8698,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Security] Review & Fix Multiple CVEs affecting Go standard libraries","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T10:26:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8698"}
