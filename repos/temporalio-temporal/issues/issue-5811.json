Please describe.**\r\nUse cases may require that a schedule runs on the last day of the month every month. Because the last day of the month changes month to month, there isn't currently a temporal schedule configuration which supports this. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThis requested support most likely pertains to calendar specs. In the context of the Temporal Python SDK ScheduleCalendarSpec, a day_of_month from 1-31 may be given. A value of 31 could match the last day of the month regardless of which month the schedule runs on, or some alternative value such as -1.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAssembling a list of calendar specs, one per month, where the last day of each month is explicitly provided. This does not work for a schedule that needs to run indefinitely.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://temporalio.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FCTT84KXK9%2Fp1710480826848909%3Fname%3DCTT84KXK9%26perma%3D1710480826848909","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-04-29T22:13:58Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDODNqesM8AAAABbF9GFg","name":"schedules","description":"","color":"5E45A2"}],"milestone":null,"number":5811,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":12}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support last day of month as a recurring schedule option","updatedAt":"2025-09-16T17:27:51Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5811"}
