Please describe.**\r\nI would like to let temporal workers access external systems using their own identity, that certifies what activity/workflow a worker is executing, fro mwhich task list and so on. Very similar to what a GitLab job is able to do:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/authenticating-with-hashicorp-vault/\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to have Cadence generate such an identity and provide it to a worker when the worker extracts some work to do from a task list. The cadence server can generate the signed token (or call a configurable plugin to generate it) and thus certify a set of information about the activity/workflow.\r\n\r\nIf you think this is something valuable we can discuss the design more in depth and then I can work to contribute the required code.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MzUzNDc1OQ==","author":{"login":"samarabbas"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@mfateev what do you think about this feature ask?","createdAt":"2021-07-04T07:03:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/845#issuecomment-873534759","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM45rScH","author":{"login":"randomswdev"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Any update about this?
