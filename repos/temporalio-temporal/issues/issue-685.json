Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, if a parent workflow exits before a child workflow has started the child is not going to start at all. It is possible to resolve by waiting for a Promise returned from ChildWorkflowStub.getExecution(). But this is a pretty obscure and error-prone feature.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe proposal is to automatically delay workflow completion if there is an outstanding start child request that has abandon parent policy until the child reported that it started successfully. It can be done by failing the decision task and scheduling it after children have started. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI tried implementing it at the SDK level. The problem was dealing with new events (like signals) received after the workflow code has completed. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe [original SDK issue](https://github.com/temporalio/java-sdk/issues/74).","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5Qo8k7","author":{"login":"shaharco"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi, any plans for solving this soon?","createdAt":"2022-12-15T11:14:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/685#issuecomment-1352911163","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5cdiuN","author":{"login":"nitesh237"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi @yycptt @yiminc \r\n\r\nI was looking for an opportunity to contribute, this seems like a good starting point (judging by the labels).
