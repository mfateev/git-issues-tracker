Please describe.**\r\nSo I started using the Workflow ID reuse policy, ex: \r\n`workflowOpts := client.StartWorkflowOptions{\r\n\t\t\tID:                    fmt.Sprintf(\"%s-%s-delete-network\", opts.TenantID, opts.TenantName),\r\n\t\t\tWorkflowIDReusePolicy: enums.WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_ALLOW_DUPLICATE_FAILED_ONLY,\r\n}`\r\nIt works great for idempotence, but I think I've found an edge case where an addition would be helpful. I'm struggling to figure out a way to join the functionality of the idempotence that the ID duplicate failed only option presents, but not block my end users from performing workflows that create and destroy a related set of resources (say a VPN or VPC in a cloud provider).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n- run a create workflow that creates some cloud infrastructure\r\n- decide later I want to delete it (taint the ID as part of this action)\r\n- go back and run the same create workflow w/ the same ID the next day, or some other time\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI'll need to provide this protection in other lays of my application - not the end of the world, but seems like a nice to have that fits with Temporal's other functions that handle retries. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSlack thread where Maxim asked me to open a feature request: https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTDTU3J4T/p1660935514293809","closedAt":"2023-10-22T04:58:49Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5pvQOQ","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"You should be able to achieve what you want with WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_ALLOW_DUPLICATE and an idempotent RequestID.","createdAt":"2023-10-22T04:58:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3441#issuecomment-1773994896","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-08-19T20:31:32Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3441,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Reclaim workflow ID/make it available for future use","updatedAt":"2023-10-22T04:58:49Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3441"}
