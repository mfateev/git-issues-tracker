Please describe.**\r\nHey, guys. \r\nWe encountered the following problem while configuring metrics for self hosted cluster. Metrics are not labeled with a special prefix, so there is no grouping for hundreds of metrics. This in turn makes it confusing, because it is not clear whose metrics they are exactly \r\n\r\nThe example on the screen from google cloud monitoring. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"775\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/assets/23157659/6fa915a8-b63f-482e-b90c-76308d9c55db\">\r\n<img width=\"795\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/assets/23157659/b120136e-1758-4844-808b-1f0ccfc9ac30\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be cool if all metrics could be grouped under a common label, like Temporal, TemporalWorker, TemporalPoll, etc, so as not to pollute the overall scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOn the other hand, it's a pretty breakable change. It may be possible to specify a prefix through env variables, which will be empty by default (for backward compatibility), which anyone can specify and thus change the name of metrics in monitoring systems if desired\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2025-12-23T18:40:39Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6Xr4eB","author":{"login":"raymondregrello"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"It looks like Temporal supports a `global.metrics.prefix` config option (at least as of this comment): https://docs.temporal.io/references/configuration#prefix\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that this works as expected with a self-hosted Temporal cluster.\r\n\r\nNote: the Temporal helm charts don't support setting this config option yet.","createdAt":"2024-12-16T08:05:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5679#issuecomment-2544863105","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7bzEiy","author":{"login":"dustin-temporal"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Prefix is the recommended way to go here.
