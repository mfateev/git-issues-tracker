Create a workflow with an update handler that \"never completes\" (e.g. waits on a 60s timer)\r\n  1. Start the workflow, with `workflow_execution_timeout` or `workflow_run_timeout` set to a few seconds.\r\n  1. Start an update, waiting until `Completed`\r\n  1. Wait until the workflow times out, and observe that the update request is not failed but rather times out naturally (if you are using an SDK client you may not see this, since the client issue repeated poll requests behind the scenes).\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: latest server `main`\r\n","closedAt":"2024-10-31T22:40:29Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6SFt17","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Fixed in #6621 ","createdAt":"2024-10-31T22:40:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6614#issuecomment-2450972027","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-10-07T17:29:45Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":6614,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Pending update requests should be aborted when workflow times out","updatedAt":"2024-10-31T22:40:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6614"}
