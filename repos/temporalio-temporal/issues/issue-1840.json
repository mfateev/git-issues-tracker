Please describe.**\r\nCurrently temporal only supports a single elastic search index - '[temporal_visibility_v1_dev](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/elasticsearch-setup/)'  \r\nTemporal offers users advance search attributes - 'upsert-search-attributes', but with temporal elastic search implementation there is no solution in place to configure these attributes to different elastic search indices.  All of the search attributes can only be accessed by a single elastic index.\r\nIf there are 5 customer upsert-search attributes, then the only available elastic search index would be:\r\n\r\nElastic search index: **temporal_visibility_v1_dev**\r\n\r\n- Custom Search field 1\r\n- Custom Search field 2\r\n- Custom Search field 3\r\n- Custom Search field 4\r\n- Custom Search field 5\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nUser should be able to setup multiple, in this example 3 custom indices with customized custom search field mapping and update.\r\nFor example: \r\n  **Custom index 1:**\r\n- Custom Search field 1\r\n- Custom Search field 2\r\n- Custom Search field 3\r\n\r\n  **Custom index 2:**\r\n- Custom Search field 2\r\n- Custom Search field 3\r\n- Custom Search field 4\r\n\r\n  **Custom index 3:**\r\n- Custom Search field 1\r\n- Custom Search field 4\r\n- Custom Search field 5\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA large single index covering all of the custom search fields presents access challenges\r\n\r\nThere is another workaround where Custom elastic indices can be updated directly via workflow activities but then temporal native rollback will not work.\r\n","closedAt":"2026-01-20T22:04:53Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7hBH1P","author":{"login":"rodrigozhou"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We are working on having custom search attributes mapping per namespace such that the Elasticsearch index would have a fixed set of pre-allocated custom search attribute fields, and each namespace would have its own set of custom search attributes mapped to the fields in Elasticsearch (similar to what we already have when you use a SQL database for Visibility).\n\nAs for supporting multiple index, we don't have any plans to support it. However, if you are familiar with the VisibilityStore implementation, you could potentially do your own implementation, and using it as custom VisibilityStore.","createdAt":"2026-01-20T22:04:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1840#issuecomment-3775167823","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-08-19T21:05:06Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1840,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Temporal Elasticsearch support for custom index creation","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T22:05:09Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1840"}
