Please describe.**\r\nCurrently temporal only supports a single elastic search index - '[temporal_visibility_v1_dev](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/server/elasticsearch-setup/)'  \r\nTemporal offers users advance search attributes - 'upsert-search-attributes', but with temporal elastic search implementation there is no solution in place to configure these attributes to different elastic search indices.  All of the search attributes can only be accessed by a single elastic index.\r\nIf there are 5 customer upsert-search attributes, then the only available elastic search index would be:\r\n\r\nElastic search index: **temporal_visibility_v1_dev**\r\n\r\n- Custom Search field 1\r\n- Custom Search field 2\r\n- Custom Search field 3\r\n- Custom Search field 4\r\n- Custom Search field 5\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nUser should be able to setup multiple, in this example 3 custom indices with customized custom search field mapping and update.\r\nFor example: \r\n  **Custom index 1:**\r\n- Custom Search field 1\r\n- Custom Search field 2\r\n- Custom Search field 3\r\n\r\n  **Custom index 2:**\r\n- Custom Search field 2\r\n- Custom Search field 3\r\n- Custom Search field 4\r\n\r\n  **Custom index 3:**\r\n- Custom Search field 1\r\n- Custom Search field 4\r\n- Custom Search field 5\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA large single index covering all of the custom search fields presents access challenges\r\n\r\nThere is another workaround where Custom elastic indices can be updated directly via workflow activities but then temporal native rollback will not work.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-08-19T21:05:06Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1840,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Temporal Elasticsearch support for custom index creation","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:21:34Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1840"}
