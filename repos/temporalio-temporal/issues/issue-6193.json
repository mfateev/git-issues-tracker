In which case it needs to do special logic. \r\n\r\n`GetWorkflowExecutionHistory` on the other hand, handles archived workflows perfectly.\r\n\r\nThis results in the UI not being able to show workflow run page because `describe` request fails with 404.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nBe able to open a workflow run from Archived page and get the detailed history for history archival.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n404 on openning the page.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1.
