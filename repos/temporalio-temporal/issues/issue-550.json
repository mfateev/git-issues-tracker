I wanted to run a dev environment using podman instead of docker-compose. Here is a yaml file I'd like to share with the community for version 0.26 plus cassandra: https://gitlab.com/lercher/wf/-/blob/master/temporal.yaml\r\n\r\nAfter downloading, a local pod can be created and started via `podman play kube temporal.yaml`. Starting, stoping and removing the pod: `podman pod start/stop/rm temporal`. Hoping that helps ppl like me with this kind of \"root\" problems.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that something like that finds its way into the code base and the documentation, eventually. As I'm quite un-experienced using containers, that's probably a better option compared to what I did.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor easier reference, this is the current content of the file mentioned:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Pod\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: temporal\r\nspec:\r\n  restartPolicy: Always\r\n\r\n  containers:\r\n\r\n  - name: cassandra\r\n    image: cassandra:3.11\r\n    ports:\r\n    - containerPort: 9042\r\n      hostPort: 9042\r\n    resources: {}\r\n  \r\n  - name: temporal-srv\r\n    image: temporalio/auto-setup:0.26.0\r\n    env:\r\n    - name: CASSANDRA_SEEDS\r\n      value: localhost\r\n    - name: DYNAMIC_CONFIG_FILE_PATH\r\n      value: config/dynamicconfig/development.yaml\r\n    - name: BIND_ON_IP\r\n      value: 127.0.0.1\r\n    ports:\r\n    - containerPort: 7233\r\n      hostPort: 7233\r\n    resources: {}\r\n\r\n  - name: temporal-web\r\n    image: temporalio/web:0.26.0\r\n    env:\r\n    - name: TEMPORAL_GRPC_ENDPOINT\r\n      value: localhost:7233\r\n    ports:\r\n    - containerPort: 8088\r\n      hostPort: 8088\r\n    resources: {}\r\n```","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-07-16T18:13:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODkxMzc4","name":"packaging","description":"","color":"baf702"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5OTE0ODQ5","name":"docker","description":"","color":"eda6d4"}],"milestone":null,"number":550,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"creating a dev environment using podman instead of docker-compose","updatedAt":"2021-07-03T23:39:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/550"}
