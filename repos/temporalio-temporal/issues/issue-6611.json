Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen the frontend which is installed on kubernetes is exposed to Internet via ingress load balancer, the load balancer requires a health endpoint for the health-checks.  When the client authentication is enabled by mTLS the health check fails and the load balancer marks the frontend pods as failed. Therefore the setup is not functional.\r\nMost cloud load balancers today don\"t support the client certificate auth. For example we use GKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nEnable a health endpoint without auth so the load balancer can use it for health checks, \r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-10-06T20:36:19Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6611,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Expose anonymous HTTP/HTTPS health endpoint on Frontend","updatedAt":"2024-10-06T20:36:19Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6611"}
