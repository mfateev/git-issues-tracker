To get the last failure in the Activity Context ([like this](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-features/issues/92)), the Worker would need a Failure returned in [PollActivityTaskQueueResponse](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/9645a99d585b426ebb7555b8f61f5b1ed1aa42af/temporal/api/workflowservice/v1/request_response.proto#L343) (or a list of all previous Failures).\r\n\r\ncc @mjameswh ","createdAt":"2022-12-20T23:58:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3517#issuecomment-1360509589","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6qHy4R","author":{"login":"shamrin"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I stumbled upon this problem recently. I had an activity failure due to a bug in my code. Temporal - as expected - was retrying the activity. However, only the first failure had a clue in about the bug. The rest of retried attempts failed due to db constraint violation, because the first failure left the system in semi-consistent state (unique ID was taken during the first attempt). It made the problem harder to debug, because I had to dig through worker logs to see the problem.\n\nI think it would have helped if Temporal kept the details for the first failure too.","createdAt":"2025-05-06T11:07:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3517#issuecomment-2854170129","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-10-20T12:14:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3517,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Provide a way to retrieve the list of failures for one activity","updatedAt":"2025-05-06T11:07:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3517"}
