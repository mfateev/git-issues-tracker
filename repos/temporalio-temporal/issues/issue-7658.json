Temporal Server should support these prefixed tables, ensuring all existing operations remain functional.\n\n ## Benefits:\nPrevent naming conflicts in shared schemas.\nEasier management of multiple environments.\nImproved flexibility and compliance with naming conventions.\n\nThank you!\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6pogtE","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is low priority for us since most users can use separate schemas for their different deployments.
