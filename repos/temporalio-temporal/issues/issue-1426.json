Please describe.**\r\nI would like a workflow to be executed once every 15 seconds, but the fastest I can schedule a cron is once per minute using\r\n```\r\nOpts: client.StartWorkflowOptions{\r\n  ID: \"blah\",\r\n  CronSchedule: \"* * * * *\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nBeing able to control which seconds a workflow is triggered would be nice. So once a minute would be `0 * * * * *` (note that there's 6 tokens instead of 5), and once every 15 seconds would be `*/15 * * * * *`.\r\n","closedAt":"2021-04-12T21:50:15Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNjk4MjY1OA==","author":{"login":"wxing1292"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"try using `@every 30s`","createdAt":"2021-04-09T21:30:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1426#issuecomment-816982658","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxODI2NjAzNg==","author":{"login":"danielwang5"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"That works, thanks!","createdAt":"2021-04-12T21:50:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1426#issuecomment-818266036","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-04-01T20:53:23Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1426,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support Cron Schedules faster than per minute for workflows","updatedAt":"2021-04-12T21:50:15Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1426"}
