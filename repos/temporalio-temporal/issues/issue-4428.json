Please describe.\r\n\r\nIf a temporal client schedules an action to occur 10s later, e.g. `Workflow.await('10s')`, but there is 1s of delay in network travel time and/or persistence lag, then the net effect is an 11s delay when the client only specified 10s. This effect isn't terribly noticeable until network delay or persistence lag spikes.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to specify the deadline of a timer as an absolute timestamp / ISO string, rather than a relative delay. Then the 1s lost in network transit / persistence lag would not affect the time that the workflow is scheduled to be resumed.\r\n\r\n**_This is actually a win for the developer experience as well_**, since in some situations we start by knowing the target time we would like to resume our workflow, and the calculation to determine the delay between now() and the target time is unnecessary / cumbersome.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nOriginally discussed in this Temporal [Slack thread 🧵](https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTT84KXK9/p1685563043149169).\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-06-01T12:44:30Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDODNqesM7-SUnK","name":"feature-request","description":"","color":"4C2E9C"}],"milestone":null,"number":4428,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support fixed deadline timers","updatedAt":"2023-06-02T21:37:50Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4428"}
