Please describe.**\r\nOn our Temporal projects we use context propagators to pass cross-cutting parameters across the \"temporal stack\", i.e. the user that is running a workflow etc.\r\nThis works fine, anyway a use case arised where we need to set/change some of these variables within an activity (but it may be also within a workflow) and have it \"propagated\" when the result of the activity is returned to the calling workflow.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe would like to be able to change contxt propagated vars within activity/workflow.
