We should limit the depth to something like 10/15. Can discuss implementation design on how this limitation occurs (not sure we should reject the failure but up to implementer). I can also provide more exact numbers on how deep before Python fails if that information is needed.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM57_NxK","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Server is not crack open those failure and just pass it along.
