Not sure where to post this, but I was hoping to see if the [temporalio/web](https://hub.docker.com/r/temporalio/web/tags) docker hub image could get support for `arm64`? Most of the other images have this support already (e.g. `temporalio/auto-setup`), so just wanting to see if the `web` image can be brought up to parity.\r\n\r\nThanks!! 🙏 ","closedAt":"2022-01-27T21:23:53Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM49A68F","author":{"login":"APTy"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Closing in favor of https://github.com/temporalio/web/issues/420","createdAt":"2022-01-27T21:23:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2415#issuecomment-1023651589","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-01-25T19:00:50Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":2415,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Docker hub arm64 support for temporal/web image","updatedAt":"2022-01-27T21:23:54Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2415"}
