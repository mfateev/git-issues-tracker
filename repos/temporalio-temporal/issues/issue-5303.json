Please describe.**\r\nCurrently signaling a closed workflow will throw error, but there are several cases:\r\n\r\n* Workflow really doesn't exist (or deleted after retention)\r\n* Workflow is completed/terminated/etc (closed)\r\nAs an application, we sometimes need to handle the two cases differently(error handling).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe error should should be able to return \"WorkflowStatus\" inside.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently we have to make a DescribeWorkflowExecution API call to achieve this. This requires more code, more error handling, and higher latency .\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1969\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-16T19:04:21Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5303,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Provide WorkflowStatus in when signing a workflow that is closed","updatedAt":"2024-01-16T19:04:21Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5303"}
