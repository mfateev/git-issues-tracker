Please describe.**\r\nGiven that IP Addresses can commonly change on container restart, there is need to support this scenario on cluster failure. Currently, due to how we coordinate membership in the database, there is a scenario in which a cluster could have all nodes fail and simultaneously change IP Addresses, in this case, there is no way to identify that these new nodes are replacement nodes for previously heartbeating members. Due to this, these nodes will attempt to connect to previously down nodes to join the ringpop cluster rather than initializing a new ringpop cluster, leading to a cascading failure.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIf the initialization logic is retried after the healthyHostLastHeartbeatCutoff timeout (20 seconds), this could solve this problem in the short-term. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMore invasive changes could be done for better performance to avoid additional overhead, but these may require changes in the ringpop library itself.\r\n","closedAt":"2020-07-03T01:51:48Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-07-01T20:32:18Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":1,"title":"Initial Temporal Release","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":493,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support Dynamic Cluster IP Addresses in Failure Scenarios","updatedAt":"2020-07-03T01:51:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/493"}
