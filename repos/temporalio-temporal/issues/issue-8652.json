Please describe.**\nTemporal supports Cassandra as a storage backend, and ScyllaDB is often presented as a drop-in Cassandra alternative. It’s currently not mentioned in the documentation, and it's unclear whether using ScyllaDB with Temporal is recommended, unsupported, or simply unverified.\n\nWhile looking into this, I found a few previous discussions that touched on ScyllaDB behaviour or compatibility questions:\n\n- https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2683\n- https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3511#issuecomment-1287535816\n- Possibly related: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1267\n\nThis issue is mostly to clarify the current state and consolidate conversations in one place.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nSome clarification in the docs or guidance, such as:\n\n- ScyllaDB is expected to work, but has not been officially tested, or\n- Compatibility may be revisited in the future if there is interest.\n\nNo changes requested to core code right now - just a clearer direction for users evaluating storage options.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Relying on scattered Slack/GitHub discussions.\n- Community blog posts or notes (easy to get outdated).\n\n**Additional context**\nOpening this issue to track the topic and give a single reference point if ScyllaDB or Temporal contributors decide to explore this further. Happy to add more details if helpful. I would also be happy to add the note about ScyllaDB support (in whichever way the team prefers)\n\nThanks a lot in advance!","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-11-16T16:55:29Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":8652,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Documenting the current state of ScyllaDB as a Cassandra-compatible Backend","updatedAt":"2025-11-16T16:55:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8652"}
