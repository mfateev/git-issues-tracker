Please describe.**\r\nI'm always frustrated when we have multiple timers being created, and it's unclear in the UI which is related to what part of the flow. We have a resettable timer and an overall timer, and when several timers get created, it can be tricky to see whether the right one was created or it was part of the loop and the first timer just re-created\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA way to add metadata to the Timer. Say adding a name or something that would help readability in the UI.\r\n\r\nCurrent\r\n```\r\nTimer 37()\r\n...\r\nTimer 41()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuggested\r\n```\r\nTimer 37() SubscriptionTimer\r\n...\r\nTimer 41() UserCancelTimer\r\n```","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5Ixx4S","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Would it work for you if the UI shows the duration of the timer?
