As we continue to expand support for more databases, any changes to the persistence layer will require ever growing boilerplate changes slowing down feature development with the added risk of database-specific bugs due to bespoke implementations per DB.\r\n\r\nI've been investigating ways to reduce time spent here and have been investigating SQL query builders such as:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel\r\n- https://github.com/elgris/sqrl\r\n- https://github.com/go-jet/jet\r\n\r\nThese would give us object interfaces similar to C# linq/Java streams for SQL operations, with some of the libraries providing full compile-time type safety. No support for Cassandra, but this could collapse our MySql and Postgres implementations. I would highly recommend we spend more time looking into this before implementing another SQL database type.
