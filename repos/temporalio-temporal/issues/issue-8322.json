Please describe.**\n\nThe temporal server logs the following log line _every time a task runs_ without the task queue `kind` set:\n\n```\nlevel=WARN msg=\"Unspecified task queue kind\" service=frontend wf-task-queue-name=devbox-temporal-server:pay-server:shared wf-namespace=dev>\n```\n\nAs a result, it dominates server log output. [`kind` is well-documented to default to \"Normal\"](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/ae312b0724003957b96fb966e3fe25a02abaade4/temporal/api/taskqueue/v1/message.proto#L47), so it seems odd to warn about this behavior.\n\nThe Ruby SDK we are using does not pass `kind`, so every Ruby task we run generates this log line. This seems like a high amount of logs for a non-issue!\n\nSource of log line: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/5c26e48486a412d212e88a6faba14d3439627111/service/frontend/workflow_handler.go#L859\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nDon't emit this log line by default. Maybe move it to a verbose option if it's useful for some.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nWe may try to patch our Ruby SDK to pass `kind` to silence this log line, but I believe the community would benefit from less log chunder.\n\n**Additional context**\nNone.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7D6RLV","author":{"login":"jvilk-stripe"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"It looks like this was reported before and should've been fixed in 1.24:\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5903\n\nBut I appear to be using a version with that change, and still see the warning:\n\n```\n$ /pay/deploy/devbox-temporal-server/current/temporal --version\ntemporal version 1.3.0 (Server 1.27.1, UI 2.36.0)\n```","createdAt":"2025-09-12T21:12:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8322#issuecomment-3286831829","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-09-12T21:07:06Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":8322,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Don't log a warning when task queue kind is unspecified","updatedAt":"2025-09-12T21:12:00Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8322"}
