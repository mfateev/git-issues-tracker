The internal uses of the SDK should set it to something besides `temporal-go` to not conflate it with actual `temporal-go` clients. Can use something like `temporal-server` or similar.\r\n\r\nWe intentionally do not expose a way to change this today, so you either need to set metadata after this is applied (i.e. client interceptor) or set another field like `client-name-override` or similar that will tell you, when consuming, to use it instead of the default one from the SDK.","closedAt":"2023-11-29T03:18:17Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-08-04T19:12:22Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4730,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Stop reporting internal SDK client use as the Go SDK","updatedAt":"2023-11-29T03:18:17Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4730"}
