Please describe.**\r\n[This post](https://community.temporal.io/t/use-case-async-input-collector/1332) in the forum describes a DSL workflow that supports reexecution of the past tasks based on a signal. Such reexecution is trivial to implement for an open workflow. The problem is that it is not possible to signal a closed workflow and resetting a workflow is not enough to change its behavior.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI propose adding `SignalWithReset` API. When called the service is going to reset the workflow to the last workflow task and deliver the signal to it atomically. This would allow the workflow to handle the new signal according to its business logic.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-01-20T02:25:45Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5NzgzNzUw","name":"API","description":"Issues/features involving the API","color":"3d910f"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTM4ODI4MTE3","name":"up-for-grabs","description":"Issues to consider for external contribution","color":"69CD90"}],"milestone":null,"number":1203,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":5}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add SignalWithReset","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:22:35Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1203"}
