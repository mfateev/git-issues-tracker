Please describe.**\nCompiling external services, temporal server, for custom authentication is inconvenient.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAuthentication provides a plugin architecture where one doesn't need to compile temporal-server.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n1. Golang's plugin package - https://github.com/cwjenkins/temporal/pull/1/files (quick draft that works)\n2. Hashicorp plugin package - https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin\n3. wazero/wasm as a plugin - https://github.com/knqyf263/go-plugin (this is a wrapper for reference)\n\n**Additional context**\nEach has their drawbacks...\n1. Go's plugin package isn't very friendly which they are very open about on the packages page\n2. hashi's is over RPC so its a bit of a performance hit\n3. wasm is more work than desirable to get extensions going.\n\nCurious to converse given we like temporal thus far and we are going the compile w/ custom auth route, but looking to discuss what other options may be avail.\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7ScFbF","author":{"login":"gow"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Hello @cwjenkins, I'm assuming you have explored the [auth plugin interface](https://docs.temporal.io/temporal-service/configuration#authentication-and-authorization) and referring to that when you say \"going the compile w/ custom auth route\". We strongly encourage using this method to customize authentication and authorization in your temporal server. Some of the benefits of this method are:\n1. Compile time checks (minimizes runtime errors)\n2. Efficient (ex: no rpc calls)\n3. Simplified deployment (since everything is in the same process)\n\nThe drawback is that it needs recompilation as you noted.\n\nRegarding your request about plugin architecture without recompilation - If implemented, it would be in one of the forms you listed in the alternatives. And as you noted either they increase complexity or introduce performance hits. We have mainly stayed away from them for the same reasons. The server code is already quite complicated and we are careful about introducing additional complexity in form of new frameworks.\n\nDoing a quick search of past issues, I didn't find any public conversations on this topic. Curious to hear what the community thinks.","createdAt":"2025-11-14T02:41:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8636#issuecomment-3530577605","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7ZM1aM","author":{"login":"gow"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This was closed by mistake (due to a faulty integration).
