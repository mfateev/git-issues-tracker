Please describe.**\r\nThere are many situations where tasks in Temporal are protected by timeout tasks.  Most of the time these timers end up being redundant when workflows/tasks complete successfully.  \r\nFurther user can create user timers in the future and never need them because workflow completes well before them.  \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'm proposing a background job which scans all timer queues and delete any tasks for expired workflows/tasks.  \r\nOne thing to consider is that we use range deletes when cleaning up timer queues and moving cursor.  This may need not be an option to remove tasks individually.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-07-20T23:03:00Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTc2NTM3NTI4","name":"difficulty: medium","description":"","color":"ffaf11"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDAxNDk5NzYw","name":"operations","description":"","color":"f9d0c4"}],"milestone":null,"number":574,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Background scan to remove unnecessary timers","updatedAt":"2021-07-03T23:35:50Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/574"}
