But this is something that maybe we want to consider in the future.\n\nAnother approach would be to get the info via server APIs from the workers. But that requires 1) workers be running 2) user gives task queue name in the request so server knows which worker to get the info from.\n\nGiven the limitations of the second approach do you think it's going to still be helpful for your use case?","createdAt":"2025-12-12T00:08:56Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8764#issuecomment-3644328908","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-12-05T19:30:23Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":8764,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Listing workflows and activities from temporal sdk","updatedAt":"2025-12-12T00:08:56Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8764"}
