We don't want to give only one ip for `ES_SEEDS` because it can be changed thus we want to give our Kubernetes service definition. But our services contain port as well. I can give empty `ES_PORT` but still there is \":\" character between seeds and port.\r\n\r\nWe also tried to give all IPs of the cluster seperated by comma(which is we didn't want to), but in this case Temporal server got some errors from Elasticsearch, It tried to send a request like this `POST 10.10.10.1,10.10.10.2,10.10.10.3/mapping.`\r\n\r\nWe can make `ES_PORT` totally optional in both auto-setup and Temporal server. What do you think about this? Do you have any different suggestions to us?\r\n\r\nOr we can set `ES_SERVER` directly that it can overwrite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2025-02-19T06:29:35Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-09-18T15:33:25Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":6531,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Using Kubernetes service discovery for ES_SEEDS","updatedAt":"2025-02-19T06:29:35Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6531"}
