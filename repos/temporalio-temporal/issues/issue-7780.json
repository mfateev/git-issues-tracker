Please describe.**\n\nWe are self-hosting OSS Temporal in our Kubernetes cluster. We are required to expose only secure APIs, including metrics APIs, from any container running in our cluster.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA feature that allows to load a dedicated certificate different from the Temporal's inter-node and frontend certificate for the metrics endpoint. \n\nFor example, we would like to run other services within the mesh and run self-hosted Temporal with native TLS, and with that model, Prometheus is already loaded with the service-mesh certificate to scrape from other containers. So, if Temporal can serve the metrics endpoint with the same certificate, it would be straightforward for Prometheus to access the HTTPS metrics endpoint.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAlternatives are really tough, tried to put the temporal inside the service mesh, didn't work well. \n\n**Additional context**\n-N/A-\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6zb0dy","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We don't currently have plans to work on this but you're welcome to contribute.","createdAt":"2025-06-26T22:51:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7780#issuecomment-3010414450","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-05-15T16:40:23Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":7780,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support for HTTPS metrics endpoint on OSS Temporal","updatedAt":"2025-06-26T22:51:33Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7780"}
