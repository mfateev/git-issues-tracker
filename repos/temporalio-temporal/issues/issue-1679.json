Disable a namespace: make it no longer possible to submit new workflows to a namespace\r\n2. Disable and hide namespace: same as above, but also suppress the namespace from the \"namespace list\" API's\r\n3. Soft delete. Delete a namespace but do it in such a way that undelete is possible\r\n4. Hard delete. Remove the namespace from the db with no possibility of undelete\r\n\r\n4 (and maybe 3?) would require a crawl of the db to ensure there are no references to the namespace, in the form of active or unarchived workflows.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2022-10-20T18:25:43Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3MTU3NDI0OA==","author":{"login":"davidalpert"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"this ability would be super duper helpful for people learning about temporalio as it is easy to create namespace before thinking through or even understanding consequences of a naming strategy.\r\n\r\nthe ability to rename or delete namespaces is pretty important in that sense to make experimentation cheaper.\r\n\r\nat this point it seems that my only option is to drop the temporal database and recreate it using the schema migration tools","createdAt":"2021-06-30T16:57:41Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1679#issuecomment-871574248","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg3NjgxNjYzNw==","author":{"login":"tristan-instacart"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Just having requirements 1 and 2 would be extremely beneficial for operations in larger organizations, even if we have to wait longer for requirements 3 and 4.
