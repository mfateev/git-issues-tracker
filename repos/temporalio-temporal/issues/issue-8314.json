Similar discussion found in [this thread](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1628#issuecomment-2672959241), where it is clarified that the server does not support conflict policies for child workflows.\n\nCurrently, it looks like the only way I can configure this behaviour is with `WorkflowIdReusePolicy.TERMINATE_IF_RUNNING`. Do I have any other options when it comes to child workflows?","closedAt":"2025-09-11T20:30:09Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-11T14:48:23Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":8314,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"`WorkflowIdReusePolicy.TERMINATE_IF_RUNNING` deprecated or not?","updatedAt":"2025-09-11T20:30:09Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8314"}
