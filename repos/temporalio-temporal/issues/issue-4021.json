Please describe.**\nToday if workflow is signal directly via the Signal api (not workflow-to-workflow signal), signal requestID will be store in workflow mutable state forever, which will result in an increase in mutable state size, which could lead to performance issue when say there're 30K signal requestIDs.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\n* Simply rely on the existing max signal count limit.\n* Give up the existing guarantee we have on signal deduplication and remove those requestIDs before workflow is closed.\n  * Expire requestID based on time (still need to enforce the max signal count limit)\n  * Expire requestID based on count \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5aVUkz","author":{"login":"yycptt"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Same as https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4191","createdAt":"2023-04-20T00:14:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4021#issuecomment-1515538739","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-03-07T02:21:34Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDODNqesM8AAAABGnVHrA","name":"P0","description":"","color":"D93F0B"}],"milestone":null,"number":4021,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Expiration policy for signal requestIDs in mutable state","updatedAt":"2023-04-20T00:14:31Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4021"}
