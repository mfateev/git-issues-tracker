The Cron library that we use does not do any special handling of DST transitions. Avoid schedules that include times that fall within DST transition periods.\nIs there any plan to implement something like DST transition policies, along the line of:\n* duplicate_dst: RUN_FIRST, RUN_LAST, RUN_NONE\n* missing_dst: SHIFT, SKIP\nor something like this that would control the behavior of Temporal Schedules in the case of DST transitions?\n\nIf not configurable, maybe make the default the most intuitive one, i.e. de-duplicate and shift missing run.\nIt's the default behavior of Airflow.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6-n0qZ","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTRCR8RBP/p1755181450558259","createdAt":"2025-08-18T19:19:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8205#issuecomment-3198110361","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6_BgD3","author":{"login":"korncola"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"old sysadmin rule in Europe: never schedule a cron EVER between including 2:00 - 3:00 👍 \nAlso never use 23:59 or 0:00 cause leap second.","createdAt":"2025-08-20T08:36:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8205#issuecomment-3204841719","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7H4blw","author":{"login":"kritika2"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Is this issue available to be picked up?","createdAt":"2025-09-30T19:09:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8205#issuecomment-3353459056","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7YdYsT","author":{"login":"maximethebault"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"> old sysadmin rule in Europe: never schedule a cron EVER between including 2:00 - 3:00 👍 Also never use 23:59 or 0:00 cause leap second.\n\nAgreed, always schedule in UTC when you can (and especially for sys-admin based tasks). However, there are some cases where you unfortunately need the schedule in local timezones. A simple example : triggering an e-mailing campaign at a local schedule (because 8AM vs 9AM makes a difference).","createdAt":"2025-12-09T10:53:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8205#issuecomment-3631581971","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-08-18T19:18:52Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDODNqesM8AAAABbF9GFg","name":"schedules","description":"","color":"5E45A2"}],"milestone":null,"number":8205,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Improve DST handling in schedules","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T10:53:23Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8205"}
