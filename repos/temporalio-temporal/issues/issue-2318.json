Please describe.**\r\nI'm working in a company that heavily uses MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas. So it makes sense for us to run everything through MongoDB as our primary data store specially when it comes to backup / restore, you don't want to have multiple databases.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would say, there is support for casandra and sql databases, it shows there should be some way ( maybe easy way ) to use Atlas as persistent layer.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe are already using python celery in other part of our business services, but we are looking for alternatives and this can help us to move forward with evaluations.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAlso, we are happy to invest into the project by providing development capacity for this task. Let me know if that could be an option to consider.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5ndtYY","author":{"login":"StanislavPrusac"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"+1 for MongoDB as Persistent! <3 ","createdAt":"2023-09-26T16:01:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":4}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2318#issuecomment-1735841304","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM54giwI","author":{"login":"ajzawawi"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"+1 for mongodb.
