Please describe.**\nIn some scenarios, many users need frequently query a current workflow state. For example, 100 developers are watching for a CI/CD pipeline status.\nMost of the query results are the same, so there is no need to recalculate them unless workflow returns a different value. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd caching of query results. Update the cache only if the query result is updated as part of the last workflow task.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThere is a proposal to create a long poll query. But I can see the need for query optimization when a long poll is not possible. I think these features can be implemented or at least designed together.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-02-23T18:27:18Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3988,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add query result caching","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T18:02:20Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3988"}
