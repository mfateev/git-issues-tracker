Please describe.**\r\nWorkflows that call continue-as-new frequently can lead to hot shards.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMany workflows rely on continue-as-new to process large datasets. Many of those workflows do not receive any external signals that require addressing them by WorkflowID. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is to support an option to continue-as-new to change WorkflowID. The whole chain of workflows still can be navigated through correspondent ids in the events as well listed using visibility queries.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-08T18:13:42Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5881,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Continue-as-new with a different WorkflowID","updatedAt":"2024-05-08T18:13:42Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5881"}
