Please describe.**\r\nFrom a [support topic:](https://community.temporal.io/t/best-way-to-get-the-previous-decisiontaskcompleted-id-from-a-specific-activity/638):\r\n\r\n> The other day we had this issue where the team responsible for service C told us to rerun the request again since they were presenting issues and the 200 OK we got was a false positive.\r\n> So we did it manually, They were just a few requests affected so we could do it without problems. But now we wonder what would happen when we got 1000 affected requests and we had to do it again.\r\n> That’s why we were trying to find a way to get (in a programmatic way) the event id to use in the CLI.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSupport reset that accepts an activity type and status (OK, Failed, Any) and resets workflow from that point. It assumes that reset can recreate the activity task for all activities that completed after the reset point.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-09-19T23:10:02Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5OTIzMjY4","name":"architecture","description":"","color":"ad9fe0"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTc2NTM3NzMy","name":"difficulty: hard","description":"","color":"ff0000"}],"milestone":null,"number":741,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support reset starting from an activity of a specific type.","updatedAt":"2021-07-04T07:17:34Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/741"}
