Please describe.**\r\nCurrently a ParentClosePolicy is always applied when parent calls continue as new. In the majority of the cases it is not a desired behaviour and the policy should be applied only when a parent completes its execution.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nChange ParentClosePolicy to a structure with two fields: The current ParentClosePolicy enum and \r\napplyOnParentContinueAsNew. When applyOnParentContinueAsNew is set to true then the policy applies when parent continues as new. When set to false only when parent completes.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-05-13T17:15:40Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5NzgzNzUw","name":"API","description":"Issues/features involving the API","color":"3d910f"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTc2NTM1ODQ2","name":"difficulty: easy","description":"","color":"68d662"}],"milestone":null,"number":373,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Change ParentClosePolicy to struct and add applyOnParentContinueAsNew","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:23:34Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/373"}
