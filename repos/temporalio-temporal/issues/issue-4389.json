Please describe.**\r\nActivity inputs consume history space and are not used when recovering workflow state through the replay.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDo not persist activity inputs; in case of failures, reconstruct them by querying or replaying workflow. Assuming that workflow code is deterministic, the inputs can be reconstructed at any time. The same mechanism also can be used to show inputs in UI.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nStore inputs separately from the history and don't return them by default when replaying workflows.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCustomer using query called by each activity as a workaround:\r\n\r\n> We have a workflow where we pass the JSON (Object) in all those activities (assume 20) to perform operations.  It increases the DB size as well as the history cache. If in the activities we can get it using the stub query it will not be the part of the every activity registered with workflow and inside activity we can query from workflow. Is that the right approach to go with ?","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5enrHJ","author":{"login":"robholland"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I'm not sure how the UI would be able to derive the inputs, it cannot see or run the workflow code.","createdAt":"2023-06-12T14:27:24Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4389#issuecomment-1587458505","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5rVJHj","author":{"login":"mfateev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Workflow can implement a special query to produce these inputs through replay.","createdAt":"2023-11-08T00:19:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4389#issuecomment-1800704483","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2023-05-24T14:27:27Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4389,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Do not record activity input in the workflow history","updatedAt":"2023-11-08T00:19:45Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4389"}
