Server log indicate that it is stuck in the start child transfer with error like `\"msg\":\"Operation failed with internal error.\",\"error\":\"createOrUpdateCurrentExecution failed. Failed to insert into current_executions table. Error: pq: value too long for type character varying(255)\",\"error-type\":\"serviceerror.Unavailable\"`\n\nThis is bad from user experience POV.
