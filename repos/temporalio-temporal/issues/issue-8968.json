For general questions use [community forums or slack](https://temporal.io/community).\n\nSemantically, the fairness weight is a property of a fairness key, and controls the weighting of that key relative to other keys. Using multiple weights for the same key for different workflows/activities doesn't really make sense semantically, although as you note, it is allowed by the api (this is so that the key->weight mapping can be stored externally, and change over time). If you do use different weights for the same key, the effective behavior will be something like an average of the weights.","createdAt":"2026-01-12T19:03:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8968#issuecomment-3740053452","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2026-01-08T09:11:12Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":8968,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Same fairness key but different fairness weight?","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T19:03:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8968"}
