Please describe.**\r\nThe default out-of-the-box metrics have been very helpful. Meanwhile, I thought adding custom labels (dimensions) to these metrics would offer more precise insights for troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nFor example, we are submitting thousands of WorkflowA instances, each with multiple subtype values. While `temporal_workflow_failed` is a useful metric for tracking failures, we would have better insights if we could add subtype as a custom label in the metric, such as `temporal_workflow_failed{..., subtype=...}`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhen adding a custom Search Attribute, it would be helpful if Temporal provided an option to include these attributes as metric labels. This would make it easier to centralize and use custom Search Attributes directly in metric labels.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nIf it were possible to reference and copy the default out-of-the-box metrics within workflow or activity code, we could modify these metrics to include additional labels.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-11-05T17:38:40Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6754,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Adding a custom label to Temporal out-of-the-box metric","updatedAt":"2024-11-05T17:38:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6754"}
