Please describe.**\r\n\r\n***User scenario:***\r\n\r\n**My scenario:**\r\nI have multiple workers listening on the same task queue for high throughput.\r\nAll the workers need to do some setup and cleanup work from time to time.\r\n**My requirement:**\r\nthe business client can send a workflow or a command, which can be picked up and executed by all workers, instead of only one of them.\r\nIs there any solution?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMy strawman proposal is to have a metadata map that is returned as part of every workflow or activity task. An admin API should support updating this map. The SDKs should watch for map changes and execute appropriate logic to notify workers about the changes.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5uHvpE","author":{"login":"skandragon"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I have a similar use case for this feature.\r\n\r\nI am running a workflow that requires a large amount of data to be available and updated for workflows to run, so downloading this every run is undesirable. I could have each workflow check the centralized source of this, but that is also an API call per workflow, and most of the time there's no update.","createdAt":"2023-12-08T16:57:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3309#issuecomment-1847523908","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-09-06T16:16:45Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3309,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":7}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Notify all workers on a task queue","updatedAt":"2023-12-08T16:57:04Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3309"}
