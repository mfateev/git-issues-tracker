Please describe.**\r\nThe activity input is not really being used for replay. It's mainly for debugging(could be useful for cluster replication as well but can be eliminated/improved if designed properly).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAllow workflow to not include argument/input in the actiivty task scheudled event. Just like local activity options: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/806eab71f2b65f762cdd1c4079d3fbad0b62ae1d/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/activity/LocalActivityOptions.java#L58\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUsing local activity could do that. However, local activity could run into sideffect when it has high failure rate -- the history will get blowed up with many timer events for retry management. (see https://community.temporal.io/t/local-activity-vs-activity/290/3 )\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis needs server to support because the input is needed to pass to activity task, to activity worker.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-17T18:23:12Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5310,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Allow(optionally) omit activity argument/input in the activity task scheduled event to save the storage cost","updatedAt":"2024-01-17T18:25:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5310"}
