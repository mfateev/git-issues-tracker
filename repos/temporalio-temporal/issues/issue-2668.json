Please describe.**\r\nI have been very frustrated over the last two hours, because I haven't seen any documentation for how to actually customize the connection for my postgresql database.\r\n\r\nI

strongly recommend rethinking the consistency of these environment variables, as it has lead me and to a great deal of confusion, or documenting all the docker-compose files with descriptions.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5BR57Y","author":{"login":"jbreiding"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Thanks, we are going to track this under a larger
