Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the `CallTarget` type passed to the Temporal server's `Authorizer` only includes the namespace and API name of the action being performed, which gives us the authorization granularity to authorize a user to the scope of \"they may execute _any_ workflow in a given namespace\", but we have some use cases that are a bit more specific.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd like to be able to add more information into the `CallTarget` so we can authorize a user to the scope of \"they may execute _this_ workflow type with _these_ arguments on _this_ task queue.\"\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTo achieve this, we'd like some additional fields added to the `CallTarget`. For example:\r\n\r\nFor Workflow Execution\r\n* Workflow Type\r\n* Task Queue\r\n* The arguments\r\n\r\nFor Signals\r\n* Signal Name\r\n* The argument\r\n\r\n...along with similar fields for the other API types that could come from the client like `CancelWorkflow`, `TerminateWorkflow` and `CompleteActivity`.","closedAt":"2021-04-23T15:56:23Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyNTc1NDMyOQ==","author":{"login":"jprobinson"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Fixed in #1432 ","createdAt":"2021-04-23T15:56:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1368#issuecomment-825754329","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-03-10T19:04:05Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1368,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add Workflow and Signal information to Authorizer's CallTarget struct","updatedAt":"2021-04-23T15:56:23Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1368"}
