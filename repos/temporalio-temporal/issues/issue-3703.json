Please describe.**\r\nWorkflow history for failed workflows is purged in temporal after retention time period expires, sometimes fixing a specific defect in complex system can take greater time than retention time for failed workflows.\r\nTrying to reset the workflow after issue has been fixed may not work if the workflow history has been purged, even if the history snapshot was saved for reference when the original issuer occurred. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWorkflow authors or support teams should be able to save the temporal workflow & replay the stateful history even if the history has been purged from temporal.\r\nCurrent Replayer only allows in memory replay, AFAIK we cannot have a new run spawned from workflow history json.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2023-10-22T04:37:29Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5QzvSn","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This sounds like a workflow import functionality.
