Clone https://github.com/benkelukas/temporal-cron-continue-as-new\r\n  2. Run docker-compose build\r\n  3. Run docker-compose up\r\n  4. Run docker-compose exec app php app.php periodic:start\r\n  5. Wait for 2 Continue-As-New triggers\r\n  6. Observe Workflow being completed and no new CRON run scheduled\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.19.0\r\n  - Platform: MacOS\r\n","closedAt":"2023-01-03T19:35:37Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5RqtOG","author":{"login":"dnr"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"#2146 wasn't fixed, it was just marked as a dup.
