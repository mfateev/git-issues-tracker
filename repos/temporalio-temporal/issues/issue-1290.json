I don't know if there's a better place to ask question.\r\n\r\nI'm new to Temporal. I was wondering, is it possible to store some data structure in a running workflow, I want the data can be shared between activities and retrievable from outside by using some SDK method. If it's possible, would you please direct me to the SDK method that I should use.\r\n\r\nbtw. I read through all the examples you provide, none of them is related to persist retrievable data in workflows.
