Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI find it hard to learn this framework. \r\n\r\nI've read https://docs.temporal.io/docs/temporal-explained/introduction .  This article is very good. \r\n\r\nThen I read about the concepts, like \"activity\", \"worker\" etc.  After reading them I don't think I understand them well.  To be honest they just feel like references instead of something that help you understand the framework. \r\n* It tells people all the parameters that are supported,  instead of focusing on the core roles of the components\r\n* There are lack of real-life examples when a concept is explained - for example,  associate \"activity\" , \"rety\" with order processing etc. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nSome tutorials like those in AWS or in baeldung.com will be great. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOr give a learning path, i.e. a list of documents one can read one by one ? \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","closedAt":"2021-12-10T05:26:38Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-12-08T10:59:46Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2274,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Provide tutorials or a learning path","updatedAt":"2021-12-10T05:26:38Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2274"}
