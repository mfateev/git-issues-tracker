For Cadence, it was simple, I used cdnc. I personally, really don't like the abbreviation style of putting the number of letters between the first and last characters in a word ie, k8s, l8n. \r\n\r\nI also really don't want to type of temporal everywhere, that is entirely too long of an identifier. Please specify a suffix that is appropriate and please, please, please don't pick t6l. \r\n\r\nSoo... in that vein, what are you guys thinking tprl or trl? Anything past 4 characters is excessive imo.
