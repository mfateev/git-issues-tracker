Please describe.**\r\n\r\nA user creates a schedules and sets `policy.overlap` to `ScheduleOverlapPolicy.BUFFER_ALL`. At some point in time, user now want to \"see\" the list of buffered executions (ie. executions that have been queued to be executed, one at a time, after the current workflow execution completes).\r\n\r\nAs it is now, buffered executions appears neither in `info.futureActionTimes`, `info.recentActions` nor `info.runningWorkflows`, and no other field hints that some executions are currently buffered.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n- Add a field `buffered_actions` to the `ScheduleInfo` ([code](https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/135691242e9b4ed6214a7b5e1231c1c9930ff6c8/temporal/api/schedule/v1/message.proto#L325)) structure returned by the `DescribeSchedule` API.\r\n\r\n  In its simplest form, that field could be defined as:\r\n  ```\r\n   repeated google.protobuf.Timestamp buffered_actions = 9 [(gogoproto.stdtime) = true];\r\n  ```\r\n  Arguably, it could be marginally more useful to make that field a collection of some new protobuf object, containing both the original schedule time of the buffered execution and a flag indicating how that execution got queued up (eg. the execution got queued up because the schedule time was reached, because of a backfill request, or because of a \"trigger immediately\" request).\r\n\r\n- Similarly add a field `buffered_actions` to the `ScheduleListInfo` structure, returned by the `ListSchedules` API.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-10-16T16:44:13Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDODNqesM8AAAABbF9GFg","name":"schedules","description":"","color":"5E45A2"}],"milestone":null,"number":4984,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Schedules: Make it possible to list buffered executions","updatedAt":"2023-10-21T19:01:53Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4984"}
