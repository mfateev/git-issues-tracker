This image shows two runs of a Nexus test under `WAIT_REQUESTED`. In the run on the left `NexusOperationCancelRequestCompleted` was buffered and triggered a WFT, whereas in the run on the right it was not and did not. (Note that the events are ordered by time rather than event ID, hence the buffered event on the left interrupting the WFTStarted-WFTCompleted sequence.)\n\n<img width=\"1549\" height=\"850\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12f7068a-995d-4b02-80de-343f16d2b660\" />","closedAt":"2025-09-05T00:13:48Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-08-08T16:00:02Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":8175,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"NexusOperationCancelRequestCompleted does not trigger WFT unless buffered","updatedAt":"2025-09-05T00:13:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8175"}
