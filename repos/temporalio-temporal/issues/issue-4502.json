Please describe.**\r\nThe same value can be an argument of many activities. For example, one activity returns a document, and then 1k activities are invoked, each of them receiving a document as one of the arguments. In this case, the document is going to be stored 1k+1 times in the history which is wasteful. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMy strawman is to introduce a special command (or reuse Marker command) that would store a value (as Payloads) in the history. Add support for activity/child workflow inputs and outputs reference that value (by eventId) instead of including it directly into the corresponding schedule commands.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to support referencing Payloads directly inside other events like WorkflowExecutionStarted.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFrom Slack:\r\n\r\n> To make this more concrete, i'm implementing a DSL on top of a Temporal workflow.\r\n> The DSL workflow definition has some things that need to be extracted and consumed throughout, sometimes.\r\n> Currently i'm passing around my DSL string to all functions as a \"dsl workflow context\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7GfSSd","author":{"login":"Pavan-Samtani"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Any updates to this feature request?","createdAt":"2025-09-24T18:06:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4502#issuecomment-3330090141","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-06-15T22:16:52Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4502,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":9}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support data references to avoid storing the same Payload multiple times","updatedAt":"2025-09-24T18:06:22Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4502"}
