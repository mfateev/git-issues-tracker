I’m new to contributing to Temporal and interested in helping with this bug to ensure the version upgrade notification clears correctly in the Go-based server codebase. I see @vaibhavyadav-dev submitted a fix in PR #7650. Is there still work needed, like testing, refinements, or additional changes? I’d love to dive into the version info logic and assist. Any guidance on next steps or the dev setup would be great!
