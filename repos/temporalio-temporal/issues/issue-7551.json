Please describe.**\r\n- The use case is to reset the workflow to a previous point and immediately sends a update request to update the state. \r\n- Currently, reset & update cannot be applied together. Update can happen milliseconds~second later after reset. There could be a race that when the code rely on the updated state after reset immediately, but the update request is not guaranteed to be applied atomically with reset, resulting in the reset-ed workflow execution continues with the \"old\" state. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nProvide a API, preferably something like ResetWithUpdate(...) to reset to a point of event with the update request fulfilled.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUsing workflow.Await but the approach comes with extra flags to control the logic flow.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- Slack source: https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTDTU3J4T/p1733236562254059\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6lHa4G","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Moving to features since this would apply to all SDK's and would also require server support","createdAt":"2024-12-17T11:43:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7551#issuecomment-2770185734","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6lHa4W","author":{"login":"Sushisource"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Since this is a large request that would require substantial server work, transferring to server for triage","createdAt":"2025-04-01T17:28:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7551#issuecomment-2770185750","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7LIkSM","author":{"login":"ichinna"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Any update on this?\n@Sushisource @Quinn-With-Two-Ns ","createdAt":"2025-10-15T19:50:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7551#issuecomment-3408020620","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-12-07T14:36:29Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":7551,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Atomic workflow reset & update","updatedAt":"2025-10-15T19:51:15Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7551"}
