But many of them actually require at least database. We need to categorize all tests:\r\n1. **Pure unit tests**. Doesn't require any external dependency, can be run quickly to verify basic things.\r\n2. **Integration tests, Suite 0**. Requires database and use mocks for other dependencies.\r\n3. **Integration tests, Suite 1**. Doesn't use mocks, but uses `onebox` implementation of server (which needs to be refactored to use as much as possible of production code path).\r\n4. **End to end tests**. Starts real `temporal-server` and make requests to it through API and client.\r\n\r\nEvery test category should have target in `Makefile` and instruction how to run locally.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-01-25T00:48:03Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzkwMTM1NzM5","name":"refactoring","description":"","color":"e8b181"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODQ3NDEz","name":"testing","description":"","color":"949fdd"}],"milestone":null,"number":84,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Group and categorize tests","updatedAt":"2021-07-03T22:22:46Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/84"}
