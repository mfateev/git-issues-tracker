However, after Cairo transitioned to summer time (which involves moving clocks forward by one hour), the workflow now consistently executes at 10:59 AM Cairo local time, instead of the expected 09:59 AM.\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: go.sdk@v1.16.0\n","closedAt":"2025-08-04T15:29:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM62WcmO","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We are taking a look, thanks for reporting.","createdAt":"2025-07-10T22:30:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7983#issuecomment-3059337614","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM63OqJg","author":{"login":"dnr"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I'm guessing you're using an out-of-date tzdata database.
