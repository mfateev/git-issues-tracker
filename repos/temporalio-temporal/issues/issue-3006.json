In my mind \"pause\" would suspend all timeouts and prevent any progression through the workflow code (preventing retries of any current activities as well).\r\n\r\nThis is especially useful in scenarios where a workflow encounters errors and we would like to push a fix to the worker code without worrying about timeouts on the workflow (basically we can prevent the workflow timing out and cleaning up after itself, usually this can save use recomputing anything etc.).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the issues with this could be mitigated by us adopting a different architecture. But currently our workflow provision infrastructure for themselves to run computationally heavy work on (in particular with GPUs). Ideally we don't want to waste this work by having our workflow timeout. There are ways for us to work around this of course (saving work to S3, recovery workflows and methods to resume etc.) but in general it would be much cleaner if we would simply pause a workflow that is encountering errors, scale down the compute (IE. scale the ECS service to 0), debug and fix the problem, push the change and update the service and scale back up again.\r\n","createdAt":"2023-06-20T13:09:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3006#issuecomment-1598744599","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5vXoyG","author":{"login":"Gabrn"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Does a simpler pause mechanism exist?\r\nI don't mind if timeouts are not paused as well, e.g if there is an Activity that is supposed to run in 5 minutes and the workflow is paused for 5 minutes I don't mind if the activity runs as soon as the workflow is unpaused.
