Please describe.**\nWhen unit testing timers, one uses:\n\n\n```\nSetOnTimerScheduledListener(listener func(timerID string, duration time.Duration))\n```\n\nwhich returns the string `1`, `2`, etc.  The numbers correspond to the timer creation order (i.e. first, second, third, etc...).\n\nThis means unit tests are brittle because the placement of a timer in the code will mean the position expectations will break.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA solution would be to allow for named timers similar to named goroutines and gochannels.  Then pass that name into something like\n\n\n```\nSetOnNamedTimerScheduledListener(listener func(timerID string, name string, duration time.Duration))\n```\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAlternatives are:\n1) don't make unit tests to test timer firing order (non-ideal)\n2) make unit tests and accept they will be brittle and developers will learn to fear changing the ordering of timers in the code\n3) make support workflow code to introduce named timers at the workflow level\n\n**Additional context**\nhttps://community.temporal.io/t/testing-a-timer-fired/7371/2\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5XE7X-","author":{"login":"mfateev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"There was a similar request for activities from a customer. We don't want to use activityId for this purpose:\r\n\r\n> Good morning. I have a workflow that spans a large number of activities, and I was planning on manually setting up the activity Id, to help navigate the web UI. Doing a search here though yield this advice from a Temporal resource:\r\n> Activity ID, while technically settable, really shouldn't be manually set.\r\n> What is the best way to trace one activity amongst many for a workflow? Particularly because I will need to chain activities. Is there a way in the web UI to query for an activity Id and see all the related events? I know Temporal integrates with Datadog and other platform, etc.. but I am focusing on a POC to demonstrate the capabilities for now.\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2023-03-08T21:36:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3987#issuecomment-1460909566","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2023-02-23T14:09:49Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3987,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Named Timers","updatedAt":"2023-03-08T21:36:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3987"}
