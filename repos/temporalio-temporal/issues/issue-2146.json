I have come up with the following issue, hope you can assist me. \r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nI execute a cron workflow with the temporal go sdk. This workflow creates many other child workflows so in order to reduce the history I started using continue as new after some configurable number of iterations from the parent workflow. The issue is that it seems like the continue as new parent workflows are not cron anymore. I would expect that they will keep the same option as the original executed workflow containing the CronSchedule option. \r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nContinue as new solves the history limit problem but creates none scheduled workflows\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. create a cron scheduled workflow\r\n  2. make it continue as new after some work/time\r\n  3. notice the when all work is finished no workflow will be kept running for the next scheduled run as set in the CronSchedule\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.9.2 and web 1.9.0\r\n  - Platform: Alpine Linux\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBest Regards","closedAt":"2021-11-19T17:46:56Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM45YMMX","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@dnr please take a look. I suspect that when user code does continue as new, we lost the CronSchedule on the new run.
