Please describe.**\r\nSometimes a workflow needs the ability to reject signals that it is not listening to. For example a workflow that was canceled doesn't want to accept signals while it is performing cleanup.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd commands to enable/disable signal types. The signal type which is not enabled will be rejected synchronously.\r\n\r\nBTW the same can apply to updates.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn update can be rejected, but it requires workers to run. This feature will generate rejection even if workers are down.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-09-06T22:39:27Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4845,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add ability to reject signals by type","updatedAt":"2023-09-06T22:39:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4845"}
