Iframe is empty\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Setup temporal with docker environment. Set the corresponding environment variables like so in docker-compose.yml\r\n  ```\r\n[...]\r\ntemporal-ui:\r\n    container_name: temporal-ui\r\n    depends_on:\r\n      - temporal\r\n    environment:\r\n      - TEMPORAL_ADDRESS=temporal:7233\r\n      - TEMPORAL_CORS_ORIGINS=*\r\n    image: temporalio/ui:${TEMPORAL_UI_VERSION}\r\n    networks:\r\n      - temporal-network\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 8080:8080\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n  2. Access the exposed port via an iframe.\r\n  3. IFrame reports blocked content.\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: \r\nTEMPORAL_VERSION=1.20.2\r\nTEMPORAL_UI_VERSION=2.13.3\r\n  - Platform: \r\nLinux / Google Kubernetes Engine\r\n\r\nI want to use the UI as part of a dashboard beacause here I have the benefit of not having the user authenticate in temporal, but beforehand in the dashboard. Therefor I want to display the UI inside it, hence the IFrame.\r\n\r\nThank you for sharing this great piece of software. \r\nSuggestions appreciated.","closedAt":"2023-05-05T13:07:11Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5bkR2X","author":{"login":"getarun"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"The dedicated UI repo seems better place ofr this.
