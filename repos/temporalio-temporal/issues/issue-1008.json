Please describe.**\r\nTemporal supports extending metrics reporter through [tally-go](https://github.com/uber-go/tally) interface.  Currently we support ability to configure metrics to work with statsd, prometheus and m3db though server config.  Adding any custom support requires to create a new reporter which need to live in Temporal open source repo and might not be ideal if this metric backend is not widely adopted.  Recently it was attempted in this [PR](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/998) to add support for Atlas which supports a slight variant for statsd. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd extension point in Temporal for users to pass in custom metric reporters.  We already have well defined extension points to plugin in custom Authorizer.  And we can define similar extensibility for users to plugin custom implementation of metric reporter.\r\n","closedAt":"2020-11-25T18:58:10Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-11-18T20:41:40Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1008,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add extensibility mechanism to pass in custom metrics reporter","updatedAt":"2020-11-25T18:58:10Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1008"}
