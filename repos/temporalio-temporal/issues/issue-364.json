But if a child has called _continue as new_ or is a cron workflow the child is not terminated.\r\n\r\nLooking at the parentclosepolicy workflow [implementation](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/a694b1877462e3d79ac2f6437cf8278932b11d73/service/worker/parentclosepolicy/workflow.go#L119) I see that runID of a child is passed to a terminate request which doesn't work for children that called continue as new. \r\n\r\nThe solution is to either change semantic of RunID in the terminate to be RunID of the first workflow in the continue-as-new chain or introduce another parameter for this purpose.","closedAt":"2020-08-18T16:45:57Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-05-10T18:28:08Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg0","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":364,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"ParentClosePolicy ignores children that called continue as new","updatedAt":"2020-08-18T16:45:57Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/364"}
