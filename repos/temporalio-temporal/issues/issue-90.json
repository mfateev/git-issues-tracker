Everytime new object with these values is created, they need to be explicitly set to those default value. Otherwise they will be `0` which will be treated as regular value.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to change constants values to `0`. Event Ids starts with `1`, so `0` is good for \"unset\". `Version` is different and it might be that `0` is a valid version. We need to check entire code base and logic to be sure that versions also starts with `1`.","closedAt":"2020-08-19T20:14:22Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NjY0MjE5Mw==","author":{"login":"alexshtin"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by #634 and #642.","createdAt":"2020-08-19T20:14:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/90#issuecomment-676642193","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-01-27T19:53:45Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":90,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"EventId and Version default values","updatedAt":"2020-08-19T20:14:22Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/90"}
