I've also opened up the new tctl repo so now people can see the actual progress https://github.com/temporalio/tctl . This eventually should replace the tctl from temporal repo\r\n\r\nSpeaking of printing mechanism, the current stage of the proposal is implemented. In terms of code, here is a sample how workflow fields are picked and printed https://github.com/temporalio/tctl/blob/a400f112efa4724e841ae7e6f440bd4127b93884/cli/workflowCommands.go#L530\r\n\r\nlmk if this helps to address your questions.
