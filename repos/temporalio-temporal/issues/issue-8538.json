Up to implementer on details like field name and whether it's optional on top-level events or copied to many specific events. This should only be settable by server as the literal user identity which is assumed to be in context and work in a common way for OSS authorizers and cloud users. This is completely unrelated to existing `identity` (aka \"client identity\" or \"worker identity\") fields.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-24T15:51:34Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":8538,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Provide user identity on user-initiated events","updatedAt":"2025-12-17T20:52:35Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8538"}
