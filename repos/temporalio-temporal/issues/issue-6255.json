Please describe.\r\n\r\nMany of our workflows process a decent amount of activity data and conclude with a short final status.  We like the retention window to preserve de-duplication but don't need the full history for successfully exited workflows.  However, Temporal naturally stores the full history for the entire retention window, wasting space in Cassandra.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nOne solution to the above dilemma would be offering the ability to configure the system (perhaps on a per-workflow definition or invocation basis) where the developer indicates that the full history is unnecessary for successful workflows.  When enabled, the workflow ID and final state would remain available for de-duplication and final-state retrieval, but the rest of the history (or at least the larger parts, such as data payloads) could be optimized out of storage.\r\n\r\n### Per-SDK Tickets\r\n\r\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Go - \r\n- [ ] Java - \r\n- [ ] Core - \r\n- [ ] TypeScript - \r\n- [ ] Python - \r\n- [ ] .NET - \r\n- [ ] PHP - \r\n- [ ] Temporal CLI - \r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6EMGb5","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This seems like a server/platform request as opposed to using the issue template for a cross-SDK request in the features repo.
