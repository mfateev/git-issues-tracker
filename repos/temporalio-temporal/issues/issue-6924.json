Please describe.**\r\nYes, I'm trying to add a custom search attribute that capture duration between a collection of steps in the workflow execution. These are the subset of steps that define a business usecase in my workflow execution and hence being able to filter on workflows that exceeded a threshold is important. I'm trying to create a custom search attribute that behaves similar to the default ExecutionDuration filter. Currently temporal supports creating custom search attributes of type `Int` or `Datetime`. Neither of them support my usecase of being able to apply a filter using duration strings.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd support for creating custom search attributes of type `Duration` that allow users to filter using duration strings like `1m`, `1h` or `1d` etc.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently I'm limited to creating a custom search attribute of the type `Int` and using numeric filters. Using `Int` as the type here is limiting users from applying the correct filters.\r\nFor example: If UserA creates a custom search attribute of type Int named `myCustomDuration` and stores milliseconds in it. UserB won't know that they have to provide milliseconds as values for applying the numeric filter. \r\n\r\nBeing able to use search attributes of type `Duration` would be very useful in such cases.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-12-03T20:48:54Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6924,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support custom search attributes of type Duration","updatedAt":"2024-12-03T20:48:54Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6924"}
