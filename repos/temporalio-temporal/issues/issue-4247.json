Please describe.**\r\nRight now runId is always changed when :\r\n* ContinueAsNew\r\n* Reset\r\n* Cron\r\n* WorkflowRetry\r\n\r\nHowever, user have to rely on runId to distinguish different executions when using IdReusePolicy. For example, user starts two different runs with IdReusePolicy, and they are both completed after certain reset or continueAsNew.\r\n\r\nNow user wants to query the **final** workflow results for different runs. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nUser can provide the firstExecutionRunId to find out the last runId (filter by completed or running status) to find out the last runId. And then use the final runId to query the workflows\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUser can do search attribute themselves, but it's repeated work.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNA\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5bFVLe","author":{"login":"alexshtin"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Similar issue: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/351","createdAt":"2023-04-28T21:44:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4247#issuecomment-1528124126","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-04-27T22:09:23Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4247,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add firstExecutionRunId to system search attribute","updatedAt":"2023-04-28T21:44:05Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4247"}
