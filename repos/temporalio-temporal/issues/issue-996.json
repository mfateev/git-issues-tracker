Please describe.**\r\n\r\nthere are a range of small things we want, which may involve the same underlying code:\r\n\r\n- (small) ability to query OPEN + CLOSED workflows in a single call instead of currently double call\r\n- (nice to have) backwards pagination of a query i/o just forward pagination\r\n- API-side FILTER of event types in History (currently doing clientside) \r\n- Given a parent workflow, find all the child workflows \r\n  - (We want to make it easy to find the child workflows of a parent workflow in Temporal Web.)\r\n  - having both pending and complete workflows would be best, but we can settle for just pending first.\r\n  - Wenquan says implementation may be doable in mutableState if we only hold ID's of children\r\n  - more info: https://www.notion.so/PRD-for-Parent-Child-workflows-on-Temporal-Web-69c3ed9654a9471e819c13398766b0a9\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nwe are unopnionated on solution but recognize that we may need to wait a while for the underlying code for this to be in place to offer these APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODMwNTEwMw==","author":{"login":"wxing1292"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 1.
