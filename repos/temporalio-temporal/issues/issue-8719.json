This results in continuous dial tcp … i/o timeout errors targeting IPs of pods that no longer exist.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n1. Deploy Temporal using the official Helm chart (services running as Deployments).\n2. Trigger pod churn (e.g., rolling update, scaling down, or node drain).\n3. Observe internode gRPC logs showing repeated dial attempts to the IPs of pods that have already been terminated.\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: 1.25.2\n  - Platform: Kubernetes, using the official Temporal Helm chart, Temporal services deployed as Deployments\n\n## Additional Note / Question\n\nBefore a fix becomes available, is there any known workaround?\n\nWe are considering switching from Deployment to StatefulSet to have more stable pod identities, but this would require diverging from the official Helm chart, something we would prefer to avoid.\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated!\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7YSWZe","author":{"login":"jmooo"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Is there a workaround people are currently using to handle this issue?","createdAt":"2025-12-08T19:31:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8719#issuecomment-3628688990","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7eYLeH","author":{"login":"yycptt"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"cc @prathyushpv if you can help take a look here.","createdAt":"2026-01-09T23:04:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8719#issuecomment-3730880391","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-11-28T15:31:57Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":8719,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Stale internode gRPC connections after pod termination when using Kubernetes Deployments","updatedAt":"2026-01-09T23:04:57Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8719"}
