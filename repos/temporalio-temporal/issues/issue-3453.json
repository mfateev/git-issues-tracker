Kubernetes can query the image and detect if it runs as non-root, for instance, but not if the UID is a username and not a UID.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is more verbose than needed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsecurityContext:\r\n  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false\r\n  runAsNonRoot: true\r\n  capabilities:\r\n    drop: [\"ALL\"]\r\n  seccompProfile:\r\n    type: RuntimeDefault\r\n  runAsUser: 1000\r\n  runAsGroup: 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the UIDs were not 0, I could leave off at least the last two items.\r\n\r\nAlso, the web container uses 5000 for the temporal user...  which is likely an unneeded difference.\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version:  1.18.0\r\n  - Platform: Any (kubernetes)\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-10-04T01:57:56Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"},{"id":"LA_kwDODNqesM8AAAABGnQ9aA","name":"P1","description":"","color":"B60205"}],"milestone":null,"number":3453,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Build docker images with integer UID/GID and use the same one on all images","updatedAt":"2023-10-12T17:20:47Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3453"}
