Please describe.**\r\nThe PostgreSQL schema limits identifier lengths to 255 characters. So I set  `limit.maxIDLength` to 255 as well for server-side validation because I don't want to have any errors on the database level. However, `len(someString)` in Go returns byte size, not character count, causing issues with multi-byte characters in identifiers.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n`limit.maxIDLength` in symbols rather than bytes.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-27T10:02:46Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5454,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Identifiers length validation","updatedAt":"2024-02-27T10:02:46Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5454"}
