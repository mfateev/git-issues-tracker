While this is true, the Response was for a different update than the Acceptance that is the third message\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\nIssue multiple update requests while worker is stopped, they will be coalesced into a single WFT and so their respective Acceptance and Response messages will end up on the same WFTCompleted Response\n\n## Specifications\n* Version: v1.20\n* Platform: all\n\n","closedAt":"2023-10-22T01:27:27Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5pvIn_","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is already fixed.","createdAt":"2023-10-22T01:27:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4018#issuecomment-1773963775","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-03-06T20:30:31Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":4018,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"WFT message validaiton does not consider update instance ID","updatedAt":"2023-10-22T01:27:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4018"}
