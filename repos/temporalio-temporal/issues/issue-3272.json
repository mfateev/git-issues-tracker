Please describe.**\r\nWe have workflows that contain activities where their completion being \"best effort\" is enough. \r\nThere is no way for a workflow to skip a failed activity.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIn some scenarios we still want to catch and report activity failures, but even if the activity runs out of retries or times out, we do not want the workflow to fail entirely, instead we just want it to be skipped after their allotted retries.\r\n\r\nIs there a specific reason for this type of behavior not the be available?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSo far the only alternative to the problem is to ignore failures and return \"nil\", even if an activity fails.\r\nAlthough this works, the UI displays the activity as \"succeeded\" and our best alternative to see these cases is to log it and use metrics to quantify these cases.\r\n","closedAt":"2022-09-07T17:32:25Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5JqoM9","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I'm confused.
