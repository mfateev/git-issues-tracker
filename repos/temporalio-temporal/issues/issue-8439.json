You still need either an interval or calendar spec to actually set the time(s) to match. For this case you can use a calendar spec that matches a single timestamp.\n\nFor one-time schedules in general, though, consider using the delayed start feature on workflows instead, it's more efficient.","createdAt":"2025-10-07T13:54:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8439#issuecomment-3377007154","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-10-07T09:02:54Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":8439,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"One-time Schedule","updatedAt":"2025-10-07T13:54:32Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8439"}
