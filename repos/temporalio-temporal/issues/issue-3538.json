Please describe.**\r\nYes. I'm writing a Temporal Cloud proxy and want to reuse the `metrics` library for the codebase for consistency.\r\n\r\nIt looks like factory methods exist for metrics, but not for scope definitions, which closes the package to extension as `scopeDefinition` is unexported.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nCreate `scopeDefinition` factory methods or export `ScopeDefinition` for extension. This will allow me to extend the existing scope definitions and metrics for new uses.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUsing a separate metrics client. I don't like this because I plan to open source this proxy and would prefer to have as consistent of a development experience as possible with Temporal-proper.\r\n","closedAt":"2022-11-01T18:11:05Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5Na-63","author":{"login":"robzienert"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closing: `metrics.Client` is deprecated in favor of `metrics.MetricsHandler`, which has a much simpler interface.
