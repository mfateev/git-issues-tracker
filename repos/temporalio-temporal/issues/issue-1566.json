This is restrictive. \r\n\r\nAlso, it does not seem possible to specify initial delay. e.g. It does not seem possible to start a workflow 18 minutes from now, and then every 30 minutes after that.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a [Java Scheduled Executor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html) like functionality for Temporal workflows with all of same options.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, a user should be able to specify \r\n\r\n1. Initial Delay for first execution of a periodic workflow\r\n2. Time period for execution of a periodic workflow\r\n3. Schedule with Fixed Delay / Fixed Rate\r\n4.
