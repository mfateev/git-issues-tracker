Enable users to create collections, perform semantic searches, and pass results to downstream workflow steps without leaving the Temporal environment.\n\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\nCustom HTTP activities (requires boilerplate code)\nThird-party middleware (adds complexity)\nSeparate plugins (breaks workflow continuity)\n\n## Additional context\nNeedle has successful integrations with Zapier, n8n, and Langflow.
