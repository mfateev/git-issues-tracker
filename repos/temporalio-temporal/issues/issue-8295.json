Is there a way today to link Python-written activities to a Java workflow runner?\n\nIf not, I think it would be really helpful to have official support or patterns for mixing activity implementations across languages. This would make it easier to use the right language for the right task without having to rewrite the entire workflow or spin up fully separate workers.\n\nThanks!","closedAt":"2025-09-10T21:19:52Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7DTLnA","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It is 100% supported and often the reason that users pick Temporal.
