Either there should be an auto workflow/worker restart feature whenever a change is made kind of like npm or uv in python. Also when the workflow and workers are killed and restarted, if they are not done in order, they do not connect sometimes.\n\nSolution Suggestion: kill switch in dev mode UI, and automatic restart of processes specific to dev mode.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nRight now I just kill all terminals. Sometimes when they don't connect I have to restart all.\n\n**Additional context**\nIssues were from the hackathon repo https://github.com/temporal-community/temporal-ai-agent/tree/main","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-03T01:35:14Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":7708,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Dev Mode Improvements (Insights from AWS Hackathon)","updatedAt":"2025-05-03T01:35:14Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7708"}
