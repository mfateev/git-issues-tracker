Please describe.**\r\nAfter building pages in the Web UI to visualize Batch Operations, I observed some improvements that could be made to the `ListBatchOperations` and `DescribeBatchOperation` APIs. Specifically, when listing Batch Operations, only 4 fields are returned. This limits users in trying to differentiate their Batch Operations when listed in a tabular format, as the only uniquely identifiable field that is returned is the Job ID. Additionally, there is no way for a user to associate the Batch Operation back to a list of Workflows that were affected by the Batch Operation.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to suggest that the following additions are made:\r\n- operation type is added to the `ListBatchOperations` response. \r\n- the visibility query (or the list of workflow executions when a batch operation was created with the `executions` parameter) is returned on the `DescribeBatchOperation` response.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nN/a\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\nCurrently the information we receive in the `ListBatchOperations` API response is quite limited and does not provide a lot of meaningful context to the user.\r\n<img width=\"970\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-09 at 11 31 50 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/assets/11775628/ed4ab9a7-dc18-4ec4-9eba-d738ebda7c2b\">\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-10-09T17:35:05Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4947,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add fields to `ListBatchOperations` and `DescribeBatchOperation` API responses","updatedAt":"2023-10-09T17:44:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4947"}
