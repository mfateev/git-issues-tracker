For example some downstream API has rate limit per calling customer. This is possible to achieve using task list throttling, but as the set of keys is usually dynamic managing client side workers is a non trivial task.\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature is to provide a special task list type that would support rate limiting per some \"partition key\". So when an activity is scheduled the key should be provided when invoking it. And on the worker side no changes are needed (besides the mechanism to configure the task list itself).","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5ptOBQ","author":{"login":"lorensr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"User has a feature request for:\r\n\r\n> In this Queue, you can only process 1 activity at the time based on X field (per company, per whatever filtering)\r\n\r\nI think the X field could be this key.
