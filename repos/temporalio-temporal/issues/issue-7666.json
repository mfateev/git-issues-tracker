Please describe.**\n\nIt is a recurring orchestration need to limit the number of concurrently running Workflows of a specific type (e.g., never run more than N \"MyWorkflow\" simultaneously in a namespace or cluster). There is currently no built-in way to set a global concurrency limit by Workflow type in Temporal. Workarounds require custom dispatcher workflows or external distributed semaphores.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nA built-in semaphore/concurrency limit per Workflow type, configurable via API or workflow start options, so that Temporal itself restricts the number of simultaneously running workflows of a given type.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nBuilding custom dispatcher workflows or using external distributed locks—but these solutions are complex, fragile, and operationally heavy.\n\n**Additional context**\nA built-in semaphore would be a general and powerful solution for throttling, batching, and resource protection for a wide range of use cases.\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6pogW8","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is something that we are discussing internally but don't have clear timelines for.","createdAt":"2025-05-01T23:11:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7666#issuecomment-2845967804","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6yb1qu","author":{"login":"erdaltoprak"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hello @bergundy, are there any updates on concurrency limits for a given worker ?
