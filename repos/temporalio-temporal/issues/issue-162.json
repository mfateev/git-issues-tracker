Which means every time you register a Domain you need to specify the value for EmitMetric = true if metric needs to be enabled for domain.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the options:\r\n1. Default Value as \"true\": We could have the default value for this boolean as true.  This is not recommended practice with protobuf. \r\n2. Default Value as \"false\": User has to explicitly pass \"true\" to enable metric.  Might be bad experience if intention is to enable it for most of the domain.  \r\n3. Rename attribute to \"DisableMetric\": Default value of false will cause it to enable metric by default for domains.
