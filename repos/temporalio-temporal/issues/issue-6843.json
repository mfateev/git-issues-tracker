This would result in long poll request rate oscillating at interval of 60s. We could add some short jitter to the long poll timeout to make the requests smooth out faster.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-11-19T21:35:24Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":6843,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add small jitter timeout to the long poll empty response ","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T21:35:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6843"}
