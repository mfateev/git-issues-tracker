I found that there's a bunch of gotchas while deploying them. Some of them include:\n\n- Lack of archival support for Azure with storage containers.\n- AKS + Azure flexible postgres server fails with lots of tiny errors:\n   - Azure forces you to have TLS by default, so you have to disable TLS when you deploy it.\n   - To use visibility store as postgres in Azure, you need to enable BTREE_GIN extension which doesn't come by default.\n\nI thought these might be helpful to add in documentation. Let me know if you think this is worthwhile and please feel free to leave comments.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7LBFXd","author":{"login":"wadhah101"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"> Azure forces you to have TLS by default, so you have to disable TLS when you deploy it.\n\nHow did you get over this ?

You can enable TLS, azure already loads up the certificates in the root correctly.\n2. Disable TLS on azure infra side: This can be done with:\n     - Navigating to your Postgres flexible server instance\n     - Choose Server PArameters on the sidebar.\n     - Search for `require_secure_transport` -> Set value from on to off.\n     - save and redeploy.\n\n\nIn AWS - TLS is not strictly necessary but azure enforces it. We ended up with going to 2, as we deploy temporal in AWS without TLs and wanted to standardize.","createdAt":"2025-10-17T21:03:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8461#issuecomment-3417205114","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM7TqV7U","author":{"login":"AlonGluz"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Can I take this?, I just deployed Self hoted Temporal on EKS ","createdAt":"2025-11-19T06:57:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8461#issuecomment-3551092436","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-10-09T18:18:31Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":8461,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Adding documentation for self-hosting temporal on cloud environments.","updatedAt":"2025-11-19T06:57:52Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8461"}
