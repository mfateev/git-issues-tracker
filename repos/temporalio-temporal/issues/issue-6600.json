Please describe.**\r\nComing from a a world of Swagger/OpenAPI, there is a clearly defined documentation template around exposing an API. We would like to expose Temporal Workflows as part of a larger service, where a Temporal Workflow plays the role of a \"black box\" service call, and accordingly the front-end dev should know only what input parameters/return values are expected for a particular workflow, with the rest of the workflow abstracted away.\r\n\r\nSwagger/OpenAPI has a clearly defined structure to share between end users:\r\n[https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/basic-structure/](url)\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIs there a possibility of Temporal \r\n1. defining a consistent structure to use across projects and \r\n2. Creating tooling that can read in the consistent structure to generate a human-friendly documentation page, etc.?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCustom yaml files that are shared across teams - this requires teams to agree on their own internal standards and makes reuse of documentation across projects difficult\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-10-04T13:59:16Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6600,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Standardized Documentation Format a la Swagger","updatedAt":"2024-10-04T13:59:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6600"}
