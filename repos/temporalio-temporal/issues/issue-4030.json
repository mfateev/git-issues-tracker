Please describe.**\nFor debugging purposes, it is useful to know a query result at a specific point of workflow execution.\n\nAs a separate feature, It would be nice to be able to get a query result at each WorkflowTaskStarted event as a single API call. This would be very helpful in a certain troubleshooting scenarios.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd \"WorkflowTaskStartedEventId\" argument to query request. The workflow should be replayed up to that event id and a query should be executed against it. \n\nAdd a new API that returns a list of query results. One result per WorkflowTaskStarted eventId.\n\n**Additional context**\nThis would allow querying terminated workflows safely.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-03-08T16:11:54Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":4030,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Query at a specific WorkflowTaskStarted eventId","updatedAt":"2023-03-08T18:36:41Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4030"}
