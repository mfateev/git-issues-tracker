This naming conflict causes versioning conflicts and blocks seamless schema upgrades.\n\n## Proposed Solution:\nRename the Visibility schema’s versioning table, e.g., from `schema_version` to something distinct such as `visibility_version`. \n\n## Benefits:\nThis would allow both schemas to coexist without conflicts, enabling smoother upgrades and coexistence of multiple schema versions.\n\n## Additional Context (Optional):\nThis suggestion arose from a discussion in https://community.temporal.io/t/allow-temporal-and-visibility-schemas-in-a-single-database-by-renaming-schema-version-table/17151.\n\nThank you!","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6pohL2","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Related issue: #7658 ","createdAt":"2025-05-01T23:14:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7657#issuecomment-2845971190","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-04-24T07:08:50Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":7657,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Rename Visibility schema's version table to avoid conflict with Temporal schema","updatedAt":"2025-05-01T23:14:09Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7657"}
