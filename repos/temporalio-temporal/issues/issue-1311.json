Please describe.**\r\nCurrently the web UI will show \"Running\" for cron workflows which are created but not yet started as they are not yet due. This isn't ideal for developers as you can't tell without clicking through to the workflow whether it is actually running.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be better if the web UI was able to refer to the state rather than just the status. Temporal knows that the workflow is created but not yet started, the persistence record has \"created\" as the state. The state field isn't currently exposed via the Temporal APIs at all, which means this information is not available via tctl either.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5_BCuB","author":{"login":"namit-chandwani"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hey @robholland @yiminc @dnr @samarabbas,  I would like to get started with some beginner issue to get familiar with the temporal codebase.\r\n\r\nCan you please assign this issue to me if it hasn't been taken up by anyone yet?","createdAt":"2024-05-25T07:00:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1311#issuecomment-2130979713","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5_UaeN","author":{"login":"dnr"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This issue is pretty much obsolete since it's about the old \"cron\" feature. Instead, you could try to get started with some easy schedules bugs.
