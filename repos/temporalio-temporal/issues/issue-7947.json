Please describe.**\nGetting a list of dynamic configs could be simpler, the current way as described in the [doc](https://docs.temporal.io/references/dynamic-configuration) is to check the code. But one needs to\n- identify version of the code they're running\n-  identify the corresponding git sha of that version \n-  Then get the https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/<SOME GIT SHA>/common/dynamicconfig/constants.go .\n\n> For the complete list of dynamic configuration keys, see https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/common/dynamicconfig/constants.go. Ensure that you check server release notes for any changes to these keys and values.\n\nThis is a cumbersome process.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nA CLI/Web UI option that prints out all dynamic configs KV pairs would make things much easier.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAlternatives is doing what the doc recommends. i'e cross referencing against release notes.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-06-23T04:40:49Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":7947,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"CLI/WebUI option to list out dynamic configs","updatedAt":"2025-06-23T04:40:49Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7947"}
