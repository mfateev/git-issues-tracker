We need to bring search attributes on workflows of schedules in line w/ all others with regards to validation and metadata.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure the backwards-incompatibility ramifications are taken into account. If we eagerly validate search attributes where we didn't before, someone's automated process that creates a schedule with a future workflow _and then_ creates search attributes is now going to fail.","closedAt":"2024-02-01T17:57:21Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-08-21T19:26:39Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDODNqesM8AAAABbF9GFg","name":"schedules","description":"","color":"5E45A2"}],"milestone":null,"number":4787,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Eagerly validate and put proper metadata on search attributes for on schedule workflow action","updatedAt":"2024-02-01T17:57:21Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4787"}
