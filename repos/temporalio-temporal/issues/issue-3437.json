Create a temporal workflow and spin up a child workflow that simply sleeps for 5 minutes, and waits for the child workflow to finish execution before exiting the parent workflow. \r\n  2. While the child-workflow is in progress, reset the child workflow to the beginning of the event history. \r\n  3. The parent workflow should see a `ChildWorkflowExecutionTerminated` event when the child-workflow was reset. As a result, the parent workflow exits leaving the child workflow orphaned.  \r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.16.2\r\n  - Architecture: x86_64\r\n  - Platform: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS","closedAt":"2022-09-29T04:38:07Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5LNK-9","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is fixed in https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/2913, and available in v1.17","createdAt":"2022-09-29T04:38:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3437#issuecomment-1261744061","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-09-28T16:04:32Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":3437,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Workflow reset is broken for child/parent relationships","updatedAt":"2022-09-29T04:38:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3437"}
