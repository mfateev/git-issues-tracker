Please describe.**\r\nWe were recently debugging an issue in our QA environment where our workflows were failing trying to execute a `ListWorkflowExecutionsRequest` (in java). It turns out the Elasticsearch cluster we had setup for temporal had restrictive permissions which was leading to 403's when temporal tried to query Elasticsearch. We temporarily resolved the issue by opening up permissions between Temporal and ES.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe do not want to leave the ES permission open, so a documentation update as to which permissions are required by Temporal would be amazing.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrently our fix was to make ES open for the Temporal cluster, but this is not sustainable for us.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOriginal slack thread: https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTRCR8RBP/p1627509370447100\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-08-13T16:09:12Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1821,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Document the Elasticsearch permissions required by Temporal","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:21:34Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1821"}
