We have the same logic at the server/receiver end but is achieved via grpc interceptors. \r\n\r\nLooks like the same approach can be applied to client side as well, and avoid the complexity of code generation and the cost for maintaining it.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-08-04T18:47:31Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3183,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Replace metrics and retryable client with client interceptors","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:18:38Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3183"}
