However, currently, the error responses are being returned to the SDK caller; the desired behavior occurs because the SDK client retries the `ResourceExhaustedFailure`. So:\n\n- We need to make the server retry this internally (at least, that was out original intention)\n- I think that we want to confirm that retries will be spread out in time such that races with the CAN handling are very unlikely.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-27T11:31:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":7164,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Confirm aborted update retries schedule responsible for robustness of update to CAN","updatedAt":"2025-01-28T23:32:16Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/7164"}
