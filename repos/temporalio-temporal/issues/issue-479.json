Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, if a command misses some required attribute a very generic message is presented without any additional context:\r\n\r\nINVALID_ARGUMENT: A valid StartToClose or ScheduleToCloseTimeout is not set on decision.\r\n\r\nThis makes troubleshooting really hard as it is impossible to find out which activity failed from possible hundreds of scheduled ones.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nInclude full information about the specific scheduleActivityTask decision that caused the problem. The minimal information included is eventId of the decision. Then the client can map that id to the actual decision and its parameters.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2023-12-07T23:43:36Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-06-26T20:34:24Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg5","name":"good first issue","description":"Good for newcomers","color":"7057ff"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTc2NTM1ODQ2","name":"difficulty: easy","description":"","color":"68d662"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDAxNDk5NzYw","name":"operations","description":"","color":"f9d0c4"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTM4ODI4MTE3","name":"up-for-grabs","description":"Issues to consider for external contribution","color":"69CD90"}],"milestone":null,"number":479,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":9}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Include command eventId and potentially other info into validation messages","updatedAt":"2023-12-07T23:43:36Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/479"}
