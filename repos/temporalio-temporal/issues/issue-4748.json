A namespace is active in one cluster at a time.”\r\n\r\nI have experience building and running active-active applications on top of Cassandra, and I believe that there is the possibility of Temporal growing to support such a configuration with the right underlying DB, consistency tuning, and sharding strategy.\r\n\r\n# Question\r\nAs part of my effort to understand the momentum vector of Temporal as an open-source project, I would like to know if anyone can enlighten me about the deprecation of ringpop. I see that membership is pretty nicely abstracted now, so I wonder if there is a long-term strategy for replacing ringpop?","closedAt":"2023-10-25T03:10:11Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5j0nLX","author":{"login":"debuggerpk"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"was wondering the same.","createdAt":"2023-08-11T12:53:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4748#issuecomment-1674736343","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5oS9yQ","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, we do want to replace ringpop with a well maintained library, but this is currently not a priority.","createdAt":"2023-10-05T23:47:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/4748#issuecomment-1749802128","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5qAMNB","author":{"login":"decibelcooper"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Thanks, that is helpful for understanding where Temporal is headed.
