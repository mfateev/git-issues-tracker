The existence of https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/docker/config_template.yaml and https://github.com/temporalio/docker-builds/tree/main/docker helped me understand exactly how its possible to setup temporal via docker images, but I didn't find this documented anywhere, and had rely on combing through the repos to understand it all.\r\n\r\nI think a blog post in the same style as https://docs.temporal.io/blog/auto-setup/, but about the topic of building temporal as a binary yourself with a `development.yaml` contrasted with using a pre-built docker image (`temporalio/server`) and environment variables would be a huge help to those that want to consume temporal through docker images like me.\r\n\r\nWith that all said it wasn't clear to me whether blessing a pre-built docker image setup for production use is something that is on the roadmap or if the team strongly recommends building yourself for the medium or long-term future.\r\n\r\nSo to conclude I guess what I was hoping for was some documentation about:\r\n1. If one were to go down the path of setting up temporal through the pre-built images, how does configuration work at a high level.\r\n2. Some discussion about whether pre-build docker images for production use (and potentially even 100% parity with `development.yaml` through env vars or command options) is something that is on the roadmap or being thought about on the team.\r\n\r\nI also want to say that I am new to the community, so I apologize if this is something that has already been hashed out.","createdAt":"2022-05-28T22:00:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":14}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2891#issuecomment-1140335019","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5Mrb4o","author":{"login":"sharadregoti"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I am still facing this issue, cannot understand the difference between development.yaml & dynamiconfig","createdAt":"2022-10-21T04:47:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2891#issuecomment-1286454824","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5PTFa5","author":{"login":"leofdgit"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"+1, the docs on configuration are a bad part of what is otherwise good documentation.","createdAt":"2022-11-29T10:20:40Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2891#issuecomment-1330403001","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM6I_NPi","author":{"login":"od82078"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Has there been any progress here?
