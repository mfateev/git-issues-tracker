This only happens when there is a proxy that would hold up a request during internal server outage (very rare). This behavior has existed for years.\r\n\r\nArguably we should stop considering `InvalidArgument` non-retryable on the SDK side which may make this need moot (see https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/218). This is simply to track potential work/discussion.","closedAt":"2023-01-27T22:32:22Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5T31dO","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/3856","createdAt":"2023-01-27T22:32:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3846#issuecomment-1407145806","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-01-25T21:52:41Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":3846,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"InvalidArgument gRPC error is non-deterministic for the same arguments","updatedAt":"2023-01-27T22:32:23Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3846"}
