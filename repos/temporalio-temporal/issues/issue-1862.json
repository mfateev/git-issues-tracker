With these permissions now more fine grained, the worker role seems a bit redundant. Is it supposed to have any permissions or was this side effect intentional?","closedAt":"2021-10-18T18:44:31Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM42FDR5","author":{"login":"sergeybykov"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thank for reporting this!\r\n`defaultAuthorizer` is currently incomplete in its support for fine-grain authorization, and is meant more as a sample for custom authorizers. #1711 added support for read-only APIs.
