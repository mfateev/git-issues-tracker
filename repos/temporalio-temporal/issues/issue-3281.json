It might help to clarify a few things: you should think of a workflow execution as an abstract computation. It doesn't always happen on a single worker: the workflow execution is sliced into small computations called workflow tasks, and then those are assigned to workers as needed. Temporal already achieves high availability because of a particular worker fails, workflow tasks will be assigned to other workers. Even if a workflow task has been assigned and a worker dies, that task will get reassigned after a short timeout (10 seconds). So you don't need multiple workflow executions for high availability.\r\n\r\nAre you asking for something like, eagerly sending workflow tasks (or activity tasks) to multiple workers and taking the first result, so you don't have to wait for the workflow task timeout?","createdAt":"2022-09-08T23:05:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3281#issuecomment-1241320930","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5J_mzN","author":{"login":"CarlosEssun"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Thank you for your answer!\r\nThis is not the case, I just want to send to multiple workflows to get relevant information and execute tasks preemptively, not all workflows get this information and process.\r\nI think we have the same demand  #3309 \r\n`My requirement:\r\nthe business client can send a workflow or a command, which can be picked up and executed by all workers, instead of only one of them.\r\nIs there any solution?`\r\n","createdAt":"2022-09-09T01:54:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3281#issuecomment-1241410765","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5KnHuh","author":{"login":"dnr"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, I'll mark this as a duplicate of #3309 ","createdAt":"2022-09-20T02:45:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3281#issuecomment-1251769249","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-08-30T09:17:19Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":3281,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"How to select a workflow Execution by scheduling tasks","updatedAt":"2022-09-20T02:45:04Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3281"}
