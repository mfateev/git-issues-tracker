Set up a cross-replicated global namespace between two clusters\n  2. Execute `temporal operator search-attribute create --namespace my-ns --name AbcSearch --type Text` against active cluster (cluster-a for example purposes)\n  3. Execute the same against non-active cluster (no matter how many times this is run, it will always say `search attributes have been added`, expect to run once and all subsequent executions should raise conflict errors)\n  4. Execute `temporal operator search-attribute list --namespace my-ns` against active cluster (will maybe appear)\n  5. Execute the same against non-active cluster (will not appear)\n  6. Initiate active cluster failover using `temporal namespace update --active-cluster cluster-b my-ns`\n  7. Re-execute 3 & 5, search attributes will not update\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: 1.23.0\n  - Platform: Debian","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-06T15:11:44Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":5853,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Cross-replicated search attributes are not persistent","updatedAt":"2024-05-06T15:11:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5853"}
