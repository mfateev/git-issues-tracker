There's been some discussion about using grpc streaming for matching, but we're probably not going to pursue it in the near future.\r\n\r\nHow might traffic management/connection policies be improved with streaming? My general impression was that for traffic management, smaller shorter requests are preferable so you can load balance at a finer granularity. Of course, some things are definitely better with streaming, like connection overhead (especially authentication).","createdAt":"2022-03-07T20:52:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2565#issuecomment-1061124869","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-03-03T05:17:40Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2565,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Consider adding an option for bidirectional gRPC streaming instead of unary RPC","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:20:42Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/2565"}
