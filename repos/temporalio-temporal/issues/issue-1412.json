Please describe.**\r\nRunTimeout terminates workflow without giving it any chance to perform cleanup. So to deal with business logic timeouts timers have to be used which adds complexity to the user code.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd `WorkflowRunCancellationTimeout` (name is strawman) wich sends a cancellation request to the workflow when exceeded. This way a workflow can perform all necessary cleanup.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5HAPXK","author":{"login":"ccl0326"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"any progress?
