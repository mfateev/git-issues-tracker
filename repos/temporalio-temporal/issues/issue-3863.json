And the devs have to race against time to solve the issue before the run gets purged.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nTemporal can provide a button to mark/pin/save a run and this makes sure the run would not get purged. Later, this workflow run can be referenced with a link or otherwise. This run stored in the DB should not get deleted unless explicitly deleted.\n\n**Alternatives considered**\nDownloading workflow history json probably would work as a stopgap for saving it locally. But, some better way from the Temporal UI would be really helpful such that others can also look at it.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5Ube97","author":{"login":"yiminc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is for closed workflow?
