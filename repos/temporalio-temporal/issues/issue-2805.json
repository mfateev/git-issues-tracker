The \"Running the Worker\" section has problems.  The execution of \"go run worker/main.go\" results in error \"Task processing failed with client side error Namespace default TaskQueue TRANSFER_MONEY_TASK_QUEUE WorkerID 88909@Manrajs-MacBook-Air.local@ WorkerType ActivityWorker Error context deadline exceeded\" \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run temporal by running \"docker-compose up\" \r\n2. Follow all steps in tutorial \"https://docs.temporal.io/docs/go/run-your-first-app-tutorial\" \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt's expected that the worker polls the queue and that the task completes, like the tutorial.  The UI shows its stuck on withdraw task.  \r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information where relevant):**\r\n - OSX Big Sur 11.5.1\r\n - 1.15.0\r\n - MacBook Air (M1, 2020) \r\n - Docker\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt looks like Docker starts ok.  I've attached logs.  I understand that the task may be failing because it cannot communicate to some dependent server.   \r\n[docker-output.txt](https://github.com/temporalio/web/files/8624876/docker-output.txt)\r\n\r\nThis is complete error from running worker. \r\n\r\nWithdrawing $54.990002 from account 001-001.
