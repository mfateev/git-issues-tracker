Please describe.**\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud Platform collects logs output to `stderr` as error (means that Severity is `ERROR` ) and those output to `stdout` as non-error. When the temporal server outputs the log, whether the log level is `INFO` or `ERROR` , it outputs to the same output stream, so everything gets mixed up.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I want the feature that configures `OutputPaths` and `ErrorOutputPaths` of loggers.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd `OutputPaths` and `ErrorOutputPaths` fields to this:\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/a04944a0a174a22745f52e64128ca7c1331e792a/common/log/config.go#L29-L36\r\n\r\nAnd set those to the logger config:\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/a04944a0a174a22745f52e64128ca7c1331e792a/common/log/zap_logger.go#L199-L200\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nWe may want to consider what to do with existing configuration fields such as `Stdout` and `OutputFile`.\r\nI think we should leave it at that for compatibility.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-04-01T03:11:35Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDAxNDk5NzYw","name":"operations","description":"","color":"f9d0c4"}],"milestone":null,"number":1423,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Make output streams of logger configurable perfectly","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:22:41Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1423"}
