Please describe.**\nNamespace Delete function deletes a namespace only in the current cluster. If the environment has multiple clusters, delete namespace doesn't happen in all clusters. Separate connection need to happen to each cluster and execute the delete namespace so as it is deleted in all clusters in a multi-cluster environment set-up.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWhile registering a new namespace ClusterReplicationConfig can be passed with RegisterNamespaceRequest.  Similar capability need to be added on for Namespace Delete as well.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nWe are connecting to each cluster individually and deleting the namespace in each cluster seperately.\n\n**Additional context**\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\n\n","closedAt":"2023-10-22T01:41:19Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM5UbttF","author":{"login":"alexshtin"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Cross cluster namespace migration can be implemented with replication: enable replication for namespace and then delete in source cluster.
