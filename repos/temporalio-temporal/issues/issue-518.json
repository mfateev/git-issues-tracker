Please describe.**\r\nFrom Slack:\r\n\r\n> I tried to pass a 30MB JSON from an activity as return to workflow and have workflow pass it to the next activity. It did not work. Save it as a blob somewhere and pass back the url would be the workaround I go for, but I do wonder if Temporal can have this built in. Let the activity call Temporal to save the blob in Cassandra/MySQL, returns the id of the blob to the workflow that can pass it on. Unify how large blob is passed from activity to activity, so user of Temporal do not have to think about it and do their own implementations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTkwODU5Mw==","author":{"login":"sunshineo"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Thank you @mfateev !","createdAt":"2020-07-09T05:25:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/518#issuecomment-655908593","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-07-09T05:09:19Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5NzgzNzUw","name":"API","description":"Issues/features involving the API","color":"3d910f"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5OTIzMjY4","name":"architecture","description":"","color":"ad9fe0"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5OTIzNjU1","name":"devexp","description":"","color":"9350b7"}],"milestone":null,"number":518,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add support for passing large arguments between activities","updatedAt":"2023-03-03T20:23:04Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/518"}
