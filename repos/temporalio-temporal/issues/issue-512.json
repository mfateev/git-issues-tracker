In each location, the Consistency and SerialConsistency levels are hardcoded, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tcluster.Consistency = gocql.LocalQuorum\r\n\tcluster.SerialConsistency = gocql.LocalSerial\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese consistency levels should both be configurable. They should be made part of the Config.Cassandra struct which holds existing configurable Cassandra settings like username, password, keyspace name etc.\r\n\r\nUltimately these should be settable in the yaml config with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    persistence:\r\n      defaultStore: cass-default\r\n      visibilityStore: cass-visibility\r\n      numHistoryShards: 4\r\n      datastores:\r\n        cass-default:\r\n          cassandra:\r\n            keyspace: mykeyspace\r\n            user: myuser\r\n            consistency: Quorum\r\n            serialConsistency: Serial\r\n            ...\r\n\r\n```","closedAt":"2020-07-20T21:14:27Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1ODMwNzc0Mw==","author":{"login":"mastermanu"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the suggestion!\r\n\r\nA change for this was merged to master yesterday: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/master/common/service/config/config.go#L242\r\n\r\nWe've also updated our helm chart to indicate how to specify these: https://github.com/temporalio/helm-charts/blob/master/values.yaml#L94\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2020-07-14T17:22:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/512#issuecomment-658307743","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-07-08T18:53:57Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":512,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Cassandra Consistency and SerialConsistency should be configurable","updatedAt":"2020-07-20T21:14:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/512"}
