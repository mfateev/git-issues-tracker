In your workflow, you can wait on a signal channel. When your user is ready to start the next activity, you can send signal to the target workflow (via your web portal when user click on some button that calls temporal API to send signal or directly using tctl). Upon receiving the signal, your workflow could start activity.\r\nSee more: https://docs.temporal.io/docs/node/signals/#when-to-use-signals","createdAt":"2021-09-02T15:56:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1883#issuecomment-911831903","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODNqesM42YnWb","author":{"login":"philosophicus"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@yiminc Many thanks for your reply.\r\nIf this kind of workflows can keep running for a very long time (hours even days), and there will be a lot of them, will they eat up the resources of our whole system?

On client worker side, idle workflow is sitting in a sticky cache (LRU) doing nothing, it won't consume CPU, but it does consume some memory. However, it would be evicted if other workflows take up the slots in the LRU cache. So in general, idle workflow does not consume much. For busy workflow, it consume resource as any other code you would write.","createdAt":"2021-09-10T20:59:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1883#issuecomment-917207688","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-09-02T11:13:28Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzcwMzY2NzYw","name":"close-after-30-days","description":"","color":"1d76db"}],"milestone":null,"number":1883,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"support starting activities manually","updatedAt":"2021-10-18T18:47:41Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1883"}
