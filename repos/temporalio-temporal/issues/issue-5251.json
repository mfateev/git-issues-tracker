Instead, we plan to expose an option in the [schedules feature](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#schedule) (note: not the older \"cron\" feature whose docs you linked to) to supply a list of absolute timestamps. You could compute the list yourself and keep it updated periodically to achieve this effect. In the meantime, you could use the schedules feature with a list of calendar specs to achieve the same effect.","createdAt":"2024-01-12T20:36:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5251#issuecomment-1889917239","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-12-31T02:37:09Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5251,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Run workflows at sunset or sunrises ","updatedAt":"2024-01-12T20:36:00Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5251"}
