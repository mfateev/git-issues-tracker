I've investigated the issue and found that the problem is actually in a different repository.\n\nThe `TEMPORAL_ADMINTOOLS_VERSION=1.29.0` you're referring to is in the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repository's `.env` file, not in this repository (temporalio/temporal). \n\nThis repository (`temporalio/temporal`) builds and publishes the Docker images, which are currently tagged using `major.minor` format (e.g., `1.29`), not `major.minor.patch` format (e.g., `1.29.0`).\n\n**The fix should be made in the docker-compose repository** by updating the `.env` file from:\nTEMPORAL_ADMINTOOLS_VERSION=1.29.0\nto\nTEMPORAL_ADMINTOOLS_VERSION=1.29\n\nCould you please open an issue (or move this one) to https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose instead? That's where the actual configuration error exists.\n\nAlternatively, if the Temporal team wants to change the Docker tagging strategy to include patch versions, that would require changes to the CI/CD workflows in this repository.\n","createdAt":"2025-12-16T11:07:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8431#issuecomment-3659991643","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-10-04T15:54:52Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDE5ODE3MzQ2","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"66b9cc"}],"milestone":null,"number":8431,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Docker deployment TEMPORAL_ADMINTOOLS_VERSION","updatedAt":"2025-12-16T11:10:37Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/8431"}
