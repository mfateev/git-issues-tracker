Obviously ES being unavailable isn't great, but since Temporal queues ES writes to Kafka, it doesn't strictly _need_ ES in order to avoid data loss.\r\n\r\nObviously the ES cluster being down is an odd occurrence; ideally (especially in production) that would never happen.  But in a major outage scenario I think Temporal being a little more tolerant of failures of its dependencies would be useful.  If ES is down and I need to replace Temporal nodes due to (for example) an AWS AZ outage, currently I can't do that.\r\n\r\n(As a real example, my ES cluster went down in my development environment right now, and I'm trying to test some changes to Temporal that require restarting it, but I'm sitting here waiting for another team to fix the ES cluster without making progress, because Temporal won't start at all.)","closedAt":"2020-10-15T21:56:39Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwOTYxMTgzNQ==","author":{"login":"mastermanu"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Hey Kelnos,\r\n\r\nPlease see the linked PR request.
