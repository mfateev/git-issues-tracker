Please describe.**\r\nSometimes a backward-incompatible change in the cluster membership protocol is needed. In this case a newly deployed instances will not be able to reach the old one and the cluster will be partitioned between the old and new versions. This leads to downtime during deployment due to constant shard stealing between the partitions.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nProvide a mechanism to not distribute history and matching shards to the newly added hosts while they are deployed. After the deployment is complete flip a config switch to using only the newly added hosts for shard hosting.  This way the deployment of such an incompatible version would be possible without downtime.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-10-13T22:54:34Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":848,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support blue/green cluster deployment with incompatible cluster membership changes","updatedAt":"2020-10-13T22:54:34Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/848"}
