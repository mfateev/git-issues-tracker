Please describe.**  \r\nCurrently, certificate-filters only work with the [cloud version of Temporal](https://docs.temporal.io/cloud/tcld/namespace#import). It would be beneficial to have this functionality available in the self-hosted version as well, as it's frustrating for users running on-prem environments to lack similar security features.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**  \r\nA potential solution could be implementing a custom [myClaimMapper.go](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-server/blob/main/extensibility/authorizer/myClaimMapper.go), which would read from a certificate-filters file and use it as a claim mapper to enforce restrictions based on certificate attributes.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**  \r\nAn alternative approach could involve using an nginx gRPC proxy that applies certificate-based access control at the network level, though this might add additional complexity compared to a native Temporal solution.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**  \r\nProviding a solution that works similarly in both cloud and self-hosted environments will help maintain feature parity and improve security for self-hosted users.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-09-17T07:55:02Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":6529,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Certificate-filters in self-hosted version of Temporal","updatedAt":"2024-09-17T07:55:02Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6529"}
