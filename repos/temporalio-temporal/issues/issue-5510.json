Please describe.**\r\nClient,create_schedule allows a memo to be created on a schedule. Most schedule fields can be updated by calling ScheduleHandle.update, but it does not seem to allow the update of a memo with ScheduleUpdateInput/ScheduleUpdate. \r\nMemos may contain reference information and/or metadata for the schedule that could change depending on other changes to the schedule configuration as a result of the ScheduleHandle.update call. In order to keep the memo consistent with the updated configuration, the ability to update the memo is necessary as well.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAllow an updated memo object to be passed in the ScheduleHandle.update call in the ScheduleUpdate object. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere do not seem to be other ways to track metadata associated with a schedule apart from the memo field, so this seems to be the only solution. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-03-11T21:42:17Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":5510,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Ability to update schedule memo via Python SDK","updatedAt":"2024-03-11T21:42:17Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/5510"}
