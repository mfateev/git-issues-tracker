There are two ways to think about this feature. \r\n\r\n1. Call user code to validate workflow input and if the validation logic returns an error do not start the workflow. The drawback of this approach that if the workflow worker is down then workflows cannot be even started.\r\n2. Always start a workflow, but provide a way to not return the start call immediately waiting for the workflow code to explicitly indicate that it can be unblocked. It also could return some information to the start call from the workflow. This can be thought of as a specific application of the synchronous workflow update feature. The synchronous update is a very frequently requested feature that opens up a lot of cool use cases. But it is pretty complex to implement. Our estimate is at least a couple of months of full time developer work.
