For example, application knows that a number of signals will come in certain time window, and the workflow requires all of them to be able to make next decision. In that case, trigger a new workflow task on each received signal is a significant waste of resource.\r\n\r\nA naive approach would be adding an optional flag to signal request, that says SkipNewWorkflowTask.\r\n","closedAt":"2023-03-22T15:56:08Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-09-17T22:05:12Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIxMDMwNzg3","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":3406,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Signal without immediately trigger a workflow task","updatedAt":"2023-03-22T15:56:08Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/3406"}
