  "summary": "Support blue/green cluster deployment strategy that allows backward-incompatible cluster membership protocol changes without downtime. Currently, newly deployed instances cannot communicate with old versions, causing cluster partitioning and constant shard stealing. The request is for a mechanism to exclude newly added hosts from shard hosting during deployment, then switch to using only the new hosts after deployment completes.",

  "userImpact": "Users deploying backward-incompatible cluster membership changes currently experience downtime due to cluster partitioning; this feature would enable zero-downtime deployments.",
  "rootCause": "Cluster membership protocol changes are backward-incompatible, preventing new instances from reaching old ones, causing partitioning and continuous shard rebalancing.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a blue/green deployment mechanism: prevent history and matching shard distribution to newly added hosts during deployment, then flip a config switch to use only new hosts after deployment completes.",

  "keyQuote": "Provide a mechanism to not distribute history and matching shards to the newly added hosts while they are deployed. After the deployment is complete flip a config switch to using only the newly added hosts for shard hosting.",
