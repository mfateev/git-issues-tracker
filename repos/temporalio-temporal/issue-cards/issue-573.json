  "summary": "Temporal currently creates a timeout task for every workflow execution with a server default of 10 years, which creates unnecessary timers in the database for short-lived workflows. The proposal is to introduce an infinite timeout concept and switch the server default to infinite, avoiding creation of timeout tasks when not needed.",
