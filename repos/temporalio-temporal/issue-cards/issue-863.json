  "userImpact": "Users cannot restart Temporal nodes when ElasticSearch is temporarily unavailable, blocking disaster recovery and maintenance operations.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal startup process treats ElasticSearch connectivity as a hard requirement rather than a soft dependency, failing the entire startup if ES is unreachable.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow Temporal to start successfully even when ES is unavailable, queuing writes to Kafka for later processing when ES comes back online.",
