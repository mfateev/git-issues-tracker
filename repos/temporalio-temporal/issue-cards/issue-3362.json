  "summary": "Feature request to allow the auth interceptor to pull authentication information from custom headers instead of being limited to TLS or the standard authorization header. Users need flexibility to define where auth info is sourced from, including support for multiple headers (e.g., JWT in one header and client certificate in another).",
