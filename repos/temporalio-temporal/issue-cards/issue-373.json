  "summary": "ParentClosePolicy is currently always applied when a parent workflow calls continue-as-new, but in most cases it should only apply when the parent completes. The request is to restructure ParentClosePolicy as a struct with an applyOnParentContinueAsNew field to control this behavior.",
