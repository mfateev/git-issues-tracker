  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably use newly registered namespaces immediately, requiring error-prone workarounds to detect namespace availability.",
  "rootCause": "Namespace registration is asynchronous with a propagation delay of 10-15 seconds before the namespace becomes available across the system.",
  "proposedFix": "Make namespace registration synchronous so RegisterNamespace returns only after the namespace is immediately available, or reduce the delay to at most one second in locally deployed versions.",
  "workaround": "Call GetWorkflowExecutionHistory with a fake workflow ID and check the error status code to detect when namespace is propagated.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was resolved by implementing synchronous namespace registration or reducing propagation delay.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Namespace registration is synchronous. I.e. after the RegisterNamespace returned then it can be used without errors.",
