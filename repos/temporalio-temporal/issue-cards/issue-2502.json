  "summary": "User needs to use Elasticsearch over HTTPS with self-signed certificates in auto-setup, but curl validation fails. Requests ability to pass custom curl parameters like --insecure or --cacert to make auto-setup work with private certificate infrastructure.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users with HTTPS-only Elasticsearch clusters using self-signed certificates cannot use the provided auto-setup Docker image without creating custom scripts.",
  "rootCause": "auto-setup.sh uses curl without options to accept self-signed certificates, and the auto-setup Docker container doesn't run as root so it cannot install custom CA certificates.",
  "proposedFix": "Add ES_CURL_PARAMS environment variable option to allow users to pass custom curl parameters like -k or --cacert to the auto-setup script.",
  "workaround": "Create a custom Docker image based on temporal/auto-setup or temporal-admin-tools that includes the custom certificate and a modified auto-setup script, or run temporal as a binary with pre-installed certificates instead of using Docker.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue closed after 30 days without implementation. Workaround via custom Docker images or temporal-admin-tools was suggested as alternative.",

  "keyQuote": "Perhaps a more universal approach would be just to add the ES_CURL_PARAMS option.",
