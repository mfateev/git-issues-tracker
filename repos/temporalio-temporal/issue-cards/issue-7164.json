  "summary": "The update retry mechanism for ContinueAsNew operations currently relies on SDK client retries of ResourceExhaustedFailure, but the intention is to move retries to the server-side (gRPC interceptors/Frontend history client). Need to confirm that server-side retries are spread out in time to prevent races with CAN handling.",
