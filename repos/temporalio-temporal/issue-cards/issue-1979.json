  "summary": "Worker identity from activity heartbeats is not exposed in the describeExecution API, even though the heartbeat API accepts an identity field. The issue proposes either overriding the lastWorkerIdentity field with heartbeat identity or exposing it as a separate field to handle cases where different workers pick up and heartbeat the same activity.",
