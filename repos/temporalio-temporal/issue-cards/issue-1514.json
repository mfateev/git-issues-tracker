  "userImpact": "Users running Temporal on Google Cloud seeking alternative persistence backends face limited options and must choose between unfamiliar Cassandra operations or expensive Cloud Spanner.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal's persistence layer is tightly coupled to Cassandra's consistency model; BigTable's single-row atomicity and lack of multi-row transactions are insufficient for UpdateCurrentWorkflowExecutionForNewQuery operations.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement conditional read-then-write operations over BigTable to simulate multi-row consistency for critical queries like UpdateCurrentWorkflowExecutionForNewQuery.",
  "workaround": "Use Google Cloud Spanner (more expensive but supports necessary transactions) or invest in operating Cassandra despite unfamiliarity.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Community confirmed that BigTable's lack of multi-row transactions and complex consistency mechanisms make it incompatible with Temporal's requirements. Spanner is cost-prohibitive, leaving Cassandra as the practical choice for Google Cloud deployments.",

  "keyQuote": "big table is not targeted as a OLTP database, so if your target is to use a google product, consider spanner or cloud sql",
