  "summary": "Initial report suggested server version 1.21.4 incorrectly required all workflow task completions to handle buffered signals, but investigation revealed the actual issue was a server change rejecting signal API calls when the last workflow task has failures, which occurs during continueAsNew with buffered signals.",
