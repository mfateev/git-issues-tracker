  "summary": "The Go SDK does not emit `temporal_workflow_start` metrics for child workflows, creating an asymmetry where child workflow completions are tracked but their starts are not. The issue was resolved by migrating from `temporal_workflow_start` to granular `temporal_request` metrics tagged with API names.",
