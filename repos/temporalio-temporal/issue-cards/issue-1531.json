  "summary": "Request for server-side encryption of data at rest in the database to meet compliance requirements. Currently only client-side encryption via DataConverter is available, which requires reimplementation across multiple SDKs and adds complexity for data that doesn't need encryption in transit.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Organizations with compliance and regulatory requirements cannot easily encrypt data at rest without implementing custom client-side encryption across all SDK languages.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal server lacks built-in server-side encryption capability; encryption is only available through client-side DataConverter implementation.",
  "proposedFix": "Refactor persistence layer to use pluggable serializer/deserializer, optionally refactor Cassandra layer, and expose PayloadSerializer in temporal/server_options.go",
  "workaround": "Use a proxy in front of Temporal server to perform server-side encryption, works for both self-hosted and Temporal Cloud deployments",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "No plan to add direct server-side encryption support; users advised to use proxy solution instead",

  "keyQuote": "it's clear that the only way to currently achieve this is through client/SDK side encryption...we do _not_ need the data to be encrypted while in transit/memory",
