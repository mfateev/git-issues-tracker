  "summary": "The current throttled logger rate-limits all log lines equally, which can cause important error messages that occur infrequently to be missed while the logger is handling high-frequency repeated log lines. The proposal is to implement smarter throttling that only limits frequently repeated log lines while allowing rare errors through.",
