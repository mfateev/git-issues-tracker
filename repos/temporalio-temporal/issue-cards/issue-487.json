The request is to allow these periods to be configured independently, keeping small uniqueness records after workflow data is deleted.",

  "rootCause": "Uniqueness guarantees are implemented using the same retention mechanism that stores workflow data, preventing independent configuration of these concerns.",

  "keyQuote": "Allow uniqueness guarantee to be larger than the retention period. It would mean removing all the workflow data from DB, but keeping a small record that would preclude duplicated workflow starts.",
