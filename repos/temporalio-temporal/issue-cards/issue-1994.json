  "summary": "Request for a workflow scheduling feature that allows cron workflows to sleep for a fixed interval after completion before the next run, rather than immediately triggering at the cron schedule.

  "userImpact": "Users cannot schedule cron workflows to run at fixed intervals from completion time rather than from a fixed schedule, limiting use cases like periodic data polling.",
  "rootCause": "The cron feature currently adheres strictly to the cron schedule rather than supporting delay-after-completion patterns, which can cause back-to-back executions if the workflow completes before the next scheduled time.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a new cron feature variant that sleeps for a fixed period after each run completes before triggering the next execution, possibly as part of the new experience.",
  "workaround": "Define an outer workflow that wraps a child workflow with a sleep/loop pattern to achieve the desired interval-based scheduling while maintaining visibility into individual run statuses.",
