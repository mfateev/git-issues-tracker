  "userImpact": "Users implementing custom rate-limiting based on metadata (like request semaphores) would be able to specify exactly when retries should occur, rather than relying on fixed retry policies.",

  "proposedFix": "Add a 'RetryIn' field to retryable errors that specifies when the error should be retried, with SDK-side changes to honor this timing. Optionally support jitter to prevent thundering herd.",
  "workaround": "Configure retry policy with a fixed timeframe (without jitter) based on the semaphore timeout period, though this lacks flexibility and doesn't prevent stampeding herd issues.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented via pull request #5182 as indicated by the follow-up comment linking the solution.",

  "keyQuote": "Add a 'RetryIn' field to the retryable errors. Just like whether a retryable or nonretryable error can be returned, this can be used to set when this would be retried.",
