  "summary": "GetNextTime function enters an infinite loop when processing certain bad schedule specifications, causing high CPU usage on the Temporal frontend process. A nonsensical schedule that tries to run on Sundays while also skipping Sundays triggers this issue despite a previous fix attempt in PR #7389.",
