Investigation determined the root cause was a missing refreshInterval configuration; cert reloading actually works through Go TLS callbacks without requiring client recreation.",

  "userImpact": "Users experience connection failures to remote services when TLS certificates are updated without server restart, requiring manual rolling restart as workaround.",
  "rootCause": "User had not configured refreshInterval in global.tls (defaults to 0, disabling refresh). The caching is correct; cert reloading happens through Go TLS stack callbacks.",
  "proposedFix": "Ensure refreshInterval is properly configured in global.tls settings; no code changes needed.",
  "workaround": "Rolling restart of Temporal server to re-establish gRPC connections with new certificates.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as not a bug; investigation showed cert reloading works correctly through Go TLS callbacks. User likely had refreshInterval set to 0 or missing from configuration.",

  "keyQuote": "Reloading certs happens way below creation of grpc clients...the Go TLS stack calls them when appropriate, you don't need to recreate the grpc client.",
