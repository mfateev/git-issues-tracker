  "userImpact": "Users cannot create workflows with IDs longer than 255 characters despite configuring maxIDLength up to 1000, causing unexpected rejections in production.",
  "rootCause": "SQL schema VARCHAR(255) column limit for workflow_id is inconsistent with the dynamic configuration value (default 1000) that claims to allow longer IDs.",
  "proposedFix": "Either expand database schema to support 1000 character IDs (or 1024) and hard-code the workflow ID limit to 1000, or reduce maxIDLength dynamic config to 255. Also consider applying the same fix to all other ID fields governed by maxIDLength (Namespace, TaskQueue, ActivityID, TimerID, WorkflowType, ActivityType, SignalName, MarkerName, ErrorReason/FailureReason/CancelCause, Identity, RequestID).",
