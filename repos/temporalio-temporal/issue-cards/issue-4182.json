  "summary": "ExecuteWorkflow with certain invalid CronSchedule values (e.g., '* * 31 2 *') causes client timeout instead of returning an immediate error. The issue appears to be caused by an infinite loop or hang in server-side cron schedule evaluation when the next scheduled time resolves to an unreachable date.",

  "userImpact": "Users experience client timeouts when starting workflows with certain invalid cron schedules, with no clear error message indicating the root cause.",
  "rootCause": "Server-side cron schedule evaluation creates an infinite loop or indefinite wait when evaluating schedules that result in unreachable next execution times (e.g., February 31st).",
  "proposedFix": "Add validation to detect when cron.Next() resolves to an unreachable date (like year 0001) and return an immediate error instead of attempting to schedule.",
  "workaround": "Client-side validation using robfig/cron library: check if s.Next(time.Now()) returns a time after year 0001 and reject invalid schedules before sending to Temporal.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed via pull request #4206 which adds proper validation for cron schedules that cannot produce valid next execution times.",
