  "summary": "python-betterproto compatibility issues were identified with temporal-proto: recursive Failure object initialization causing stack overflow, and 'None' being a reserved Python keyword in QueryRejectCondition enum values. Author notes these are betterproto limitations, not proto issues, and plans to fork betterproto to accommodate.",

  "userImpact": "Python SDK users considering python-betterproto for better gRPC experience encounter incompatibility issues that require workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "python-betterproto's default field initialization behavior doesn't support HasField/ClearField semantics needed for recursive Failure objects, and uses Python reserved keywords in enum value generation.",
  "proposedFix": "Temporal team could rename enum values with type prefixes per protobuf style guide to avoid Python keywords, though this would not fully solve the betterproto compatibility.",
  "workaround": "Fork python-betterproto and modify field initialization to not instantiate sub-message fields, and adjust enum naming casing.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Temporal decided not to change proto semantics. Team noted they would add enum type prefixes anyway per style guide. Author's fork of python-betterproto is the recommended approach.",
