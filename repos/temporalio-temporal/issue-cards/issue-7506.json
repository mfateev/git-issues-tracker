  "rootCause": "The maxIDLength is a dynamic config that doesn't enforce SQL column size limits (255 chars for character varying columns), causing insert failures into current_executions table when IDs exceed the database constraint.",
  "proposedFix": "Either hardcode maxIDLength based on the persistence implementation used, or enforce a max limit based on the persistence layer to prevent exceeding database constraints.",
