  "userImpact": "Users cannot use tctl admin commands with Aurora MySQL databases without encountering connection errors.",
  "rootCause": "Aurora MySQL doesn't support the 'transaction_isolation' system variable that the standard MySQL driver attempts to set, and tctl provides no way to configure connection attributes like the service config does.",
  "proposedFix": "Add support for connection attributes in tctl (similar to --ca flag suggested in comments) or automatically handle Aurora MySQL compatibility.",

  "keyQuote": "The `transaction_isolation` variable issue remains to be an issue with Aurora MySQL. We are able to overcome this in the regular service config by specifying connection attributes",
