  "summary": "SDK needs first_execution_run_id field in StartWorkflowExecutionResponse and WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedFailure to properly handle workflow conflicts. Currently when a workflow start conflicts with an existing workflow using use-existing policy, the SDK lacks the first execution run ID needed for subsequent operations like cancel and signal.",

  "rootCause": "The API responses for conflict scenarios (started=false or WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedFailure) do not include the first_execution_run_id, requiring persistence layer changes to track this information.",
