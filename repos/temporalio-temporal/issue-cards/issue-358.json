  "userImpact": "Users running Temporal on Cassandra cannot create long-running workflows that exceed 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 without changing database configuration or accepting truncated TTLs.",
  "rootCause": "Cassandra has a built-in limitation where TTLs cannot extend past 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 due to signed 32-bit integer overflow, and this limitation propagates to Temporal's task creation.",
  "proposedFix": "Add support for explicit infinite timeout option in workflow configuration to allow users to bypass TTL constraints when using Cassandra.",
  "workaround": "Adjust Cassandra overflow policy to truncate TTLs to the 2038 limit, though this may affect retention guarantees.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved in v1.4.1 by supporting infinite timeouts for workflows.",

  "keyQuote": "Temporal could solve this problem for end users by explicitly allowing an infinite timeout when running workflows.",
