  "userImpact": "Teams with independent Activity and Workflow release cycles cannot specify Activity versions from Workflows, forcing workarounds like encoding versions in task queue names.",
  "rootCause": "Worker Versioning feature was designed for Workflows but not extended to Activities, leaving Activities without versioning support despite their independent deployment cycles.",
  "proposedFix": "Add `versioningOverride` to `ActivityOptions` and leverage existing Workflow Versioning infrastructure and `WorkerDeploymentOptions` to resolve Activities to specific Worker Deployments.",
  "workaround": "Bake the Activity version into the task queue name to pin Activity calls to specific versions.",

  "keyQuote": "Generally, during the design of this feature we've been trying to not involve the caller in worker versioning... But I don't think there is any big reason preventing us to add this feature if there are compelling use cases for it.",
