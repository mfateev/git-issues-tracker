  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently query the state of millions of actors to identify which ones are currently failing, requiring workarounds or custom Elasticsearch queries outside the Temporal API.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal list APIs return all workflow executions chronologically, but there is no built-in way to get only the most recent execution per workflow ID for aggregated state queries.",
  "proposedFix": "Add support for querying the most recent execution per workflow through either enhanced tctl/SDK list APIs or official Elasticsearch aggregation support, potentially requiring additional indexing on current run state.",
  "workaround": "Issue direct Elasticsearch aggregation queries (not officially supported, requires depending on internal unstable interfaces).",
