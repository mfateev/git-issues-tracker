  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot deploy Temporal server on IPv6-only Kubernetes clusters (AWS EKS IPv6) because the auto-setup Docker image fails to properly format and bind to IPv6 addresses.",
  "rootCause": "The auto-setup Docker entrypoint does not wrap IPv6 addresses in brackets when setting the BIND_ON_IP environment variable. Go's net.SplitHostPort requires IPv6 addresses to be formatted as '[address]:port' to parse correctly.",
  "proposedFix": "Modify the auto-setup Docker entrypoint to detect IPv6 addresses and automatically wrap them in brackets before passing to the server configuration.",
  "workaround": "Users must manually wrap the IPv6 address in brackets and ensure the auto-setup script doesn't strip them during configuration processing.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was resolved by updating the server configuration and auto-setup Docker image to properly handle IPv6 address formatting with bracket notation as required by Go's standard library.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "You need to surround host with brackets: '[2a05:d014:6e0:c883:1d45::11]:7233' works just fine.",
