  "summary": "Feature request to wrap Java's high-fidelity test service as an out-of-process server executable that can be used as a lightweight sidecar by all SDK languages. This would provide reliable testing capabilities (replays, sleep skipping) across Ruby, Go, and other SDKs instead of maintaining separate, lower-fidelity test implementations.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Enables all SDK users to write trustworthy tests with high-fidelity testing capabilities like replays and sleep skipping, reducing risk of untestable code patterns in production.",
  "rootCause": "Current SDK test implementations vary in fidelity; Ruby and Go use local synchronous testing that doesn't emulate production and doesn't support replays, sleeps, and versioning testing.",
  "proposedFix": "Wrap the Java test service in a server executable that can be deployed as a lightweight sidecar and used by any SDK language.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Out-of-process test server was implemented and merged in sdk-java#470.",

  "keyQuote": "Java is the only SDK to have a high-fidelity test service (i.e. one does replays, skips sleeps). If we wrap the java test service in a server executable, it can be used by all users of all SDKs.",
