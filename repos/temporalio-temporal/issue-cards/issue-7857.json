  "userImpact": "System workers cannot perform essential operations like history scanning and workflow cleanup when JWT authorization is enabled, causing cluster functionality to degrade.",
  "rootCause": "System workers lack proper authentication credentials when JWT authorization is enforced; they need either internal-frontend bypass or mTLS configuration to authenticate.",
