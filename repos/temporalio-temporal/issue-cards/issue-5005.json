  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily distinguish backfilled workflow executions from regularly scheduled ones, making it difficult to track and understand backfill operations in the UI.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Extend the ScheduleBackfill request to support overriding search attributes of workflow executions, similar to how ScheduleOverlapPolicy can be overridden. Modify the `addStart` function to accept a mapping of search attributes and extend the `BufferedStart` message to support search attributes.",
  "workaround": "Users can develop their own backfill abstraction on top of Temporal and track backfill metadata separately, though this is imprecise and requires external solutions.",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "A potential solution to this problem would be to extend the ScheduleBackfill request to support overriding search attributes of the Workflow Executions that are part of the backfill.",
