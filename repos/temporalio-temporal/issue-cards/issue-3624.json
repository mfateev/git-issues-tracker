  "rootCause": "Child workflows can close independently after parent closure, but the parent's mutable state retains them as pending indefinitely, triggering the pending child workflow check in the resetter.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow reset if the current run is already closed, as child workflows can close asynchronously after parent closure without sending close signals back to the parent.",
