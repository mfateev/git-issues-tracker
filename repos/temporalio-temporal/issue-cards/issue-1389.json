  "userImpact": "Users with PostgreSQL instances that don't have a 'postgres' default database (e.g., Aiven) cannot initialize Temporal databases using temporal-sql-tool.",
  "rootCause": "The PostgreSQL plugin hardcodes 'postgres' as the admin database name in the connection logic, and the --database flag does not override this value.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a configuration option to temporal-sql-tool to allow users to specify the admin database name when connecting to PostgreSQL, or try a set of default database names as suggested in issue #1413.",
  "workaround": "Modify and rebuild temporal-sql-tool from source, changing the hardcoded 'postgres' database name to the desired default.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers decided not to add special behavior for PostgreSQL in temporal-sql-tool. Issue #1413 was opened instead to try multiple default database names.",
