  "userImpact": "Users cannot set up archival with GCP Objectstore using only object-level permissions because the archiver requires bucket-level access verification.",
  "rootCause": "The GCP archiver implementation at common/archiver/gcloud/history_archiver.go calls bucket.Exists() both during archival and namespace configuration, which requires the storage.buckets.get permission not included in standard Objectstore bindings.",

  "workaround": "Add the storage.buckets.get IAM permission to the service account.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was closed due to lack of priority and interest. The maintainers indicated this is working as designed and suggested adding the required permission is the expected solution.",

  "keyQuote": "This is not a priority for us now unfortunately. Happy to take a contribution if this is important and adding permission is not an option.",
