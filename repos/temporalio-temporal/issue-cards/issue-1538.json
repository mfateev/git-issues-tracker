  "summary": "Dynamic config setting for frontend.keepAliveMaxConnectionAge was not working because the YAML value needed to be specified with a time duration suffix (e.g., '600s' instead of '600'). This was a configuration syntax issue rather than a code bug.",

  "userImpact": "Users unable to configure frontend keepalive settings dynamically, unable to tune connection timeout behavior without restarting.",
  "rootCause": "Dynamic config YAML parser requires Go duration format (e.g., '600s') but documentation or examples showed plain numeric values (e.g., '600').",
  "proposedFix": "Use '600s' instead of '600' when setting frontend.keepAliveMaxConnectionAge in dynamic config YAML.",
  "workaround": "Append 's' suffix to the duration value to specify seconds explicitly.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by identifying that the duration value requires Go time.Duration format with unit suffix.",
