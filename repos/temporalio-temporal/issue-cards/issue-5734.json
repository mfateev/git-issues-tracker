  "rootCause": "Standard visibility support was removed from docker images but the docker-compose-cass.yml file was not removed, causing health checks to fail when the visibility keyspace doesn't exist.",
  "proposedFix": "Use docker-compose-cass-es.yml (Elasticsearch-based) instead of docker-compose-cass.yml, or remove the outdated docker-compose-cass.yml file from the repository.",

  "resolutionDetails": "The docker-compose-cass.yml file is outdated and should be removed or deprecated. Users should migrate to the Elasticsearch-based compose file.",
