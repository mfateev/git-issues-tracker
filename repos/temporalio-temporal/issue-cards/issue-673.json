  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot enable Prometheus metrics in docker-compose deployments due to port conflicts and incomplete metrics collection.",
  "rootCause": "All four service roles (frontend, history, matching, worker) are instantiated with the same listen address in docker-compose, causing TCP bind failures on the same port and metric descriptor conflicts.",
  "proposedFix": "Support multiple Prometheus ports for each service role, or run each role as a separate container/pod with its own port.",
  "workaround": "Run each service role as a separate pod in Kubernetes where each has its own process and port.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was fixed but the fix was initially merged only to miroswan/temporal fork before being merged to main temporalio/temporal repository.",

  "keyQuote": "Since docker compose runs each service on the same host, we'll need four different prometheus ports for TCP binding.",
