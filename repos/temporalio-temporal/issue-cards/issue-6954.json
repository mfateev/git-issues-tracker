  "proposedFix": "Change replication logic to either: (1) Generate SyncWorkflowState task instead of historyReplicationTask when workflow closes during reset, or (2) Add new fields to Terminated event to indicate if workflow is base run. Current limitation: ResetRunID field not replicated in event-based replication until state-based replication goes live.",
