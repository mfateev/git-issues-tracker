  "userImpact": "Users cannot recover workflows that have timed out using reset, as the reset operation immediately times out the workflow again instead of allowing it to execute with a fresh timeout.",
  "rootCause": "The execution timeout is not recalculated from the time of reset; instead it uses the original timeout expiration time, causing the new run to be immediately timed out.",
  "proposedFix": "Recalculate the execution timeout from the time the workflow is reset, not from the original workflow start time.",
  "workaround": "Use WorkflowRunTimeout instead of ExecutionTimeout, as the issue does not occur when only RunTimeout is specified.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed by PR #6473 which properly handles timeout recalculation on workflow reset.",
