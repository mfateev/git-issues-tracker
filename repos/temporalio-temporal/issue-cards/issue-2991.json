  "userImpact": "This is primarily an internal refactoring that maintains existing metrics output while reducing code duplication in task type tagging.",
  "rootCause": "Static lookup tables for task type tag values are duplicated across multiple queue processors and could be replaced with dynamic generation from proto enum definitions.",
  "proposedFix": "Dynamically generate task type tag values based on the proto enum definition for task types, with options including string manipulation, proto definition updates, or introducing separate active/standby tags.",
