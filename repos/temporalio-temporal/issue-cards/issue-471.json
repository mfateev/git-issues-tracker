  "summary": "Temporal Docker container fails to bind when connected to multiple Docker networks, as it receives multiple IP addresses as a single string which the IPv4 parser cannot handle. The container needs to bind to 0.0.0.0 instead of specific IPs in multi-network scenarios.",

  "rootCause": "The getListenIP function in rpc.go:186 receives multiple space-separated IP addresses when a container is connected to multiple Docker networks, but the parser expects a single IPv4 address and fails to parse the string.",
  "proposedFix": "Bind to 0.0.0.0 in Docker scenarios to accept connections on all interfaces, or modify the IP parsing logic to handle multiple addresses and select one appropriately.",
  "workaround": "Set environment variables to explicitly bind to 0.0.0.0 and configure broadcastAddress for cluster communication, though documentation on how to do this via configuration is unclear.",
