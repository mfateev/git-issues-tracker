  "userImpact": "Enables services using Temporal to exchange payloads with different encodings and allows applications to migrate encoding schemes without disrupting running workflows.",
  "rootCause": "Binary payload fields lack metadata about their encoding, compression, and encryption, causing compatibility issues in service mesh deployments and preventing encoding migration.",
  "proposedFix": "Wrap all binary blob fields in a Payload message containing a Header with metadata map and data bytes. Support encoding types (json, raw, proto) with metadata for name, encoding, and other attributes.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented Payload wrapper with PayloadItem structure supporting metadata for encoding, names, and proto serialization across all blob fields and event attributes.",

  "keyQuote": "This would allow to specify something like: this is an encrypted field with ## version of certificate, gziped, JSON encoded.",
