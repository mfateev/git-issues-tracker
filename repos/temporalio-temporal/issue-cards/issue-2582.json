  "userImpact": "Users must manually implement custom health check endpoints for worker services, while other Temporal services have built-in handlers.",
  "rootCause": "Health status is application-specific and context-dependent; no universal definition exists for what constitutes a healthy worker.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a flag during worker initialization to enable a built-in health check server, providing sensible defaults that users can customize.",
