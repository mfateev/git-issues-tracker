  "rootCause": "Current authentication plugin interface requires compile-time implementation, preventing runtime customization without recompilation.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a plugin architecture using one of three approaches: Go's plugin package, HashiCorp's go-plugin framework, or WebAssembly (wazero). User suggests wasm might be feasible with upcoming CGO performance improvements in Go 1.26.",
  "workaround": "Compile temporal-server with custom auth code included, though this is operationally inconvenient for container deployments.",
