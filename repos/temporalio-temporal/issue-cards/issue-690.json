  "userImpact": "Users can accidentally schedule timers that will never fire due to workflow timeout, leading to unexpected workflow behavior and potential logic errors.",
  "rootCause": "Missing validation logic to check if scheduled timer duration exceeds remaining workflow execution time.",
  "proposedFix": "Add validation to fail timer creation when duration exceeds remaining execution time, or provide a boolean option to enable auto-capping of timer duration to the minimum of remaining execution time vs. specified duration.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The current behavior is to not schedule the timer if it would fire after the workflow timeout, which prevents the invalid scenario.",
