  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users must add error handling and distinguish transient errors from real deployment issues when rolling out new activities, complicating operational procedures.",
  "rootCause": "Activity task router lacks awareness of which workers implement specific activities, causing tasks to be routed to workers without the required implementation.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement worker versioning that allows the system to track which workers implement which activities and route tasks accordingly based on worker capabilities.",
  "workaround": "Use separate task queues for old and new code versions, though this requires complex operational setup and configuration.",

  "keyQuote": "It would be a cleaner experience all around if the system could somehow understand which workers implement which activities and routed the activities accordingly.",
