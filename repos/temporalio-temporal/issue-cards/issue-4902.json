  "summary": "Request to implement custom authentication between Temporal microservices (frontend, matching, history, worker). Currently, only mTLS is supported for inter-node communication, but users need the ability to send authorization tokens between internal services similar to how the Go SDK's HeadersProvider works for external clients.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot implement custom authentication mechanisms for inter-service communication in Temporal clusters, limiting authentication flexibility and forcing reliance on mTLS.",
  "rootCause": "The server-side lacks a HeadersProvider-like interface for microservices to inject custom authentication headers, unlike the Go SDK which supports this for external clients.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement an interceptor mechanism to allow custom authentication headers in all requests between Temporal's microservices, similar to the HeadersProvider interface in the Go SDK.",
  "workaround": "Configure mTLS for internode communication, but this doesn't support custom claim mappers and is less flexible than token-based authentication.",
