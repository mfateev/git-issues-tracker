  "userImpact": "Developers cannot use Temporal with VSCode development containers, blocking adoption of this development workflow.",
  "rootCause": "Path binding issue where docker-compose commands run from inside the dev container reference paths that don't exist in the docker daemon's context, typically '/workspace' is not accessible to the docker daemon.",
  "proposedFix": "Use fully qualified paths accessible to the docker daemon instead of relative paths, or use docker compose profiles to control service initialization.",
  "workaround": "Run docker-compose on the host instead of inside the dev container, or use Docker extension to manually manage container lifecycle.",
  "resolution": "stale",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed with 'close-after-30-days' label, indicating it was closed due to inactivity rather than being fixed. This is a configuration/setup issue rather than a Temporal bug.",
