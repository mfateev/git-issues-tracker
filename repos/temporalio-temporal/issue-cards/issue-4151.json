  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently handle async activity completion or apply different retry strategies for different error types, forcing inefficient workarounds with short timeouts and excessive retries.",
  "rootCause": "Activity timeout and retry configuration is immutable after activity start, preventing dynamic adjustments based on runtime conditions or error types.",
  "proposedFix": "Introduce an API to update timeout/retry config for started activities with retry, leveraging the existing mutable state storage mechanism.",
  "workaround": "Set very short start-to-close timeouts with frequent retries, but this causes inefficiency and complications (duplicate messages, additional database logic) in external systems.",

  "resolutionDetails": null,
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "One solution to this is to let activity set a smaller heartbeat timeout initially, and then update the heartbeat timeout to infinite() after successfully sending the token",
