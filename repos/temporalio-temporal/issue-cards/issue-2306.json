  "userImpact": "Duplicate retry logic across multiple layers amplifies the number of requests sent during errors, potentially overwhelming services and degrading performance during resource constraint situations.",
  "rootCause": "Retry logic is implemented at multiple independent layers (client, network API, persistence transaction) without coordination, leading to exponential retry attempts when errors occur.",
  "proposedFix": "Consolidate retry logic to specific designated layers: client (2x), service network interceptor (2x), and async task processing, with no retry within business logic.",

  "keyQuote": "When error actually happen, e.g. resource limit exceeded, retry will be done in multiple layer, causing even more requests sent to e.g. history service",
