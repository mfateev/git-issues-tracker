  "userImpact": "Applications need fine-grained control over retry behavior based on error types, and improved isolation between failing and healthy task processing.",
  "rootCause": "Current retry mechanism uses a single task queue for all retries, preventing error-specific retry strategies and causing failures to cascade across all tasks in the queue.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement separate task queues (possibly dynamic and rate-limited) for retrying activities/workflows that fail with specific error codes, allowing differentiated retry behavior and preventing cascading failures.",

  "keyQuote": "Use a different rate limited task queue to retry activities in certain scenarios. This way retries of activities that failed with a specific error code would be scheduled in a separate task queue.",
