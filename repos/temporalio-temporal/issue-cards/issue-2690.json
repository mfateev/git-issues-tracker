  "rootCause": "The broadcastAddress is set to 0.0.0.0 instead of the actual IP address, preventing proper ringpop peer discovery and joining.",
  "proposedFix": "Set global.membership.broadcastAddress to the actual IP address of the server instance (e.g., 10.114.1.1 for frontend instances) instead of 0.0.0.0.",
  "workaround": "Use 127.0.0.1 as the broadcastAddress, though this may not work for distributed deployments.",
