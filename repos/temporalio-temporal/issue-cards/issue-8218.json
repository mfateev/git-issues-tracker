  "userImpact": "Users with non-standard JWT tokens (using claim names other than 'sub' for subject) cannot use Temporal's default JWT authorizer and must implement a custom claim mapper.",
  "rootCause": "The defaultJWTClaimMapper hardcodes 'sub' as the subject claim name in common/authorization/default_jwt_claim_mapper.go, with no configuration option to override it.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a subjectClaimName configuration field to the Authorization struct, defaulting to 'sub' for backward compatibility, following the existing pattern of permissionsClaimName.",
  "workaround": "Implement a custom ClaimMapper by importing go.temporal.io/server/temporal and providing a custom implementation that maps the desired claim to 'sub'.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed due to lack of follow-up from the original poster. The issue was framed as non-standard JWT usage, with the recommended solution being either to configure the IdP to provide 'sub' claim or to use a custom ClaimMapper.",
