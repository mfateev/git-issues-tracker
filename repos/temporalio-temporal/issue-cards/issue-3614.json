  "rootCause": "Workflow IDs are generated at second-resolution timestamps, limiting only one workflow per second. When multiple triggers occur within the same second, subsequent ones fail silently because Temporal cannot have duplicate workflow IDs running simultaneously.",
  "proposedFix": "Modify server-side workflow ID generation to append a unique counter suffix (starting at -2) when duplicate IDs are detected, allowing multiple actions in the same second without requiring external uniqueness tracking.",
