  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Extend cron scheduling to activities, either by: 1) Supporting cron option on activities to re-execute on completion, or 2) Adding a method like Activity.executeAgainIn(Duration) to allow activities to schedule their own re-execution.",
  "workaround": "Use cron workflows to wrap periodic activity needs, though this adds complexity for activity-specific scheduling.",
