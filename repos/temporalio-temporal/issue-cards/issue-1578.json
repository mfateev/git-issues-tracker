  "userImpact": "Users would have a more convenient and systematic way to perform batch operations on workflow IDs, particularly for canceling cron workflows, without needing to construct manual queries.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Generate a query from the workflow_id flag (e.g., 'batch start --workflow_id test_workflow_id' translates to query like \"WorkflowId='default.test_workflow_id'\") to avoid backend API changes. Alternatively, add WorkflowId field to CountWorkflow and ExecuteWorkflow APIs.",
  "workaround": "Run visibility query after batch operation and rerun if additional running cron workflows are found. Use WorkflowId as a search attribute in the existing query flag.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "No plan to implement. Batch Operation APIs have inherent limitations where workflow state can change during batch execution, making reliable cron workflow termination challenging. Workaround recommended instead.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The challenge is the workflow state could change while that batch operation is running, and a cron workflow may have completed and started a new run.",
