  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently filter signals and updates, causing unnecessary history consumption and forcing workarounds or migration away from Temporal.",
  "rootCause": "Workflow execution currently processes all signals and updates regardless of workflow state, adding them to history even when not relevant.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement mutable allow/denylist at workflow execution start time. Future enhancement: support server-side per-WorkflowType configuration via Worker configuration.",
  "workaround": "Implement Update validation handlers (SDK-specific, not available in PHP and TS initially) that reject invalid updates, though this has limitations with timeouts.",

  "keyQuote": "Signals, even ones that workflow doesn't care about, still consume workflow history. Signals received in other states should be rejected.",
