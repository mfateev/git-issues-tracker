  "rootCause": "The auto-setup script attempts to load ES version-specific schema files (v8) that don't exist, when the v7 schema is actually compatible with ES8.",
  "proposedFix": "Remove the ES_VERSION environment variable from the auto-setup script since v7 schema works with both ES7 and ES8.",
