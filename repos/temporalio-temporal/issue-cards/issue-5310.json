  "userImpact": "Users can reduce storage costs for workflows with many activities by optionally omitting activity input from scheduled events, addressing a practical scalability concern.",
  "rootCause": "Activity input is retained in task scheduled events primarily for debugging purposes, but this increases storage overhead for large-scale deployments.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement optional input omission in activity task scheduled events similar to LocalActivityOptions, requiring server-side support to still pass input to activity workers.",
  "workaround": "Use local activities, though they have tradeoffs with failure handling and retry management that can cause history bloat with timer events.",
