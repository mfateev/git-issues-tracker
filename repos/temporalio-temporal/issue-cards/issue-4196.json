  "userImpact": "Users receive misleading context deadline exceeded errors when API calls fail due to workflow lock contention, making it difficult to diagnose the actual cause.",
  "rootCause": "API calls consume entire context timeout waiting for workflow lock, masking the real reason for failure and blocking goroutines in task scheduler for background operations.",
  "proposedFix": "Return early with a special error type (e.g., ResourceExhausted with workflow busy cause) when workflow lock cannot be acquired. Use lower timeout (e.g., 500ms) for background calls identified by caller-type context.",

  "keyQuote": "if workflow is super busy and workflow can't be locked within the given context timeout, caller side will see a context deadline exceeded error and has no clue why",
