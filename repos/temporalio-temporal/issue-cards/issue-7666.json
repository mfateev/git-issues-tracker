  "summary": "Feature request for a built-in concurrency limit (semaphore) per Workflow type to prevent too many instances of the same workflow from running simultaneously in a namespace or cluster. Users currently lack a native way to enforce this limit without custom dispatcher workflows or external distributed locks.",

  "userImpact": "Users must implement complex workarounds with custom dispatchers or external distributed locks to enforce per-workflow-type concurrency limits, increasing operational complexity and maintenance burden.",

  "proposedFix": "Add built-in semaphore/concurrency limit per Workflow type, configurable via API or workflow start options, so Temporal natively restricts simultaneously running workflows of a given type.",
  "workaround": "Custom dispatcher workflows or external distributed locks can be used, though these solutions are complex, fragile, and operationally heavy.",
