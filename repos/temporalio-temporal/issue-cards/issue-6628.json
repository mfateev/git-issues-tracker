  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot start the Temporal server using auto-setup Docker containers when the database is in a private network, blocking server deployment.",
  "rootCause": "The server performs a database schema version compatibility check during fx initialization before confirming database connectivity. When the database is unreachable from the Docker container, this check fails with a confusing error message nested in fx dependency injection logs.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Ensure the database is accessible from the Docker container by configuring proper network connectivity between the container and the database.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was determined to be a user configuration problem (database not accessible from the container), not a server bug. The confusing error message and initialization process were identified as problematic, but resolution was deferred to user configuration.",
