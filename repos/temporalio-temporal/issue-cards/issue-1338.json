  "summary": "The ResetWorkflowExecution gRPC API currently requires clients to specify a workflow_task_finish_event_id, forcing SDKs and tools to implement their own logic for determining the reset point. This issue requests moving the reset point determination logic to the service by adding a reset_type argument to support more flexible reset strategies.",

  "userImpact": "Users must currently inspect workflow history and manually find internal event IDs to reset workflows, making the reset operation brittle and unintuitive across SDKs.",
  "rootCause": "Reset point determination logic is implemented only in tctl, not exposed in the gRPC service API, preventing reuse by SDKs and making resets require low-level event ID knowledge.",
  "proposedFix": "Add reset_type argument to ResetWorkflowExecutionRequest and implement auto-selection logic in the service that finds the last WORKFLOW_TASK_COMPLETED event when WorkflowTaskFinishEventId is omitted.",
