  "summary": "Feature request to allow application errors to include a suggested retry interval duration, enabling the Temporal server to delay activity retries based on dynamic third-party rate limit responses rather than using fixed retry policies.",

  "userImpact": "Users dealing with rate-limited third-party services must choose between inefficient fixed retry intervals or complex manual retry logic in workflows.",
  "rootCause": "Application errors currently cannot specify a retry delay interval, forcing developers to either use overly conservative static intervals or implement custom retry mechanisms.",
  "proposedFix": "Extend application error to hold a retry interval value that the Temporal server uses when scheduling activity retries, with corresponding SDK updates to support sending this option.",
  "workaround": "Set RetryPolicy.InitialInterval to maximum expected delay (inefficient), or use non-retryable errors with workflow timers (complex and manual).",

  "keyQuote": "It would be nice if the application error could also hold a `retry interval` value so that the Temporal server would not schedule the activity retry until such time has elapse.",
