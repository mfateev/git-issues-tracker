  "userImpact": "Provides developers with a simpler, safer way to write Temporal workflows without needing to understand replay semantics, reducing cognitive load and common errors.",
  "rootCause": "Current Temporal workflow development requires understanding replay safety and determinism, which is counter to typical programming patterns and causes difficulty for engineers.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a WorkflowState-based DSL where users define workflow logic through state definitions with requestPrecondition and decideNextStates callbacks, executed as activities within a single framework-provided workflow.",
