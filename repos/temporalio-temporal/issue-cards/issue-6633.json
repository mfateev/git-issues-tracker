  "userImpact": "Self-hosted deployments can significantly reduce observability platform costs by using native histograms instead of classic histograms for metric collection.",
  "rootCause": "Current Server/SDK implementation only emits classic histograms; native histogram support is not implemented despite Prometheus experimental support.",
  "proposedFix": "Update Server and SDK code to export exponential/native histograms as an option alongside classic histograms, allowing teams to reduce metric series volume and costs.",
  "workaround": "Use Grafana Alloy to scrape metrics, though native histogram scraping is not currently functional with Temporal's classic histogram emission.",
