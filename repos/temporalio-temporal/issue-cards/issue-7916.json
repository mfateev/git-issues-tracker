  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users managing downstream API calls need external workarounds or multiple worker instances to implement per-activity throttling, increasing complexity and resource overhead.",
  "rootCause": "Current worker architecture supports only a single task queue per worker instance, forcing users to run multiple workers for different rate limits.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow worker.New() to accept multiple task queues with independent QueueOptions including TaskQueueActivitiesPerSecond, and enable activity execution to specify target queue via ActivityOptions.",
  "workaround": "Run multiple workers in the same process, each listening on different task queues with different rate limits, though this requires manual resource sharing management.",

  "keyQuote": "the general direction we're going in is to make a single task queue more powerful and configurable instead of requiring the use of multiple task queues",
