  "userImpact": "Users cannot selectively terminate or cancel individual runs of cron workflows; they must choose between letting the run complete or killing the entire cron scheduler.",
  "rootCause": "Cron workflow termination logic does not differentiate between terminating a specific run versus the entire cron job when a runID is specified.",
  "proposedFix": "Modify termination/cancellation behavior to only target a specific cron run when runID is provided, leaving the cron scheduler intact.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Addressed by the new Schedule feature which separates the scheduler from individual workflow runs, allowing termination of individual runs without stopping the scheduler.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "This is handled by the new schedule feature. The target workflow is separate from the scheduler. Terminate an individual workflow run won't stop the scheduler.",
