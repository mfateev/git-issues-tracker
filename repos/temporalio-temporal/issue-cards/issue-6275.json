  "summary": "User requests a way to detect when a workflow is in a failed state but still shows as \"Running\" in the UI. This occurs when workflows fail internally (e.g., due to missing exports or unhandled initialization errors) but don't transition to the actual Failed state, making error detection difficult.",
