  "rootCause": "Poll requests with deadlines within 2 seconds of server system clock return InvalidArgument status, creating non-deterministic behavior in rare scenarios with proxy delays during server outages.",

  "keyQuote": "If a poll request is made with a deadline time within 2s of the server system clock, an InvalidArgument is returned. This only happens when there is a proxy that would hold up a request during internal server outage.",
