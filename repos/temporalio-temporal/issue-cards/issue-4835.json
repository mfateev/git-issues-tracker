  "summary": "User created a cluster with only 1 history shard without understanding the implications, causing severe latency issues. They need a way to either scale up history shards after cluster creation, retroactively enable replication by converting a local namespace to global, or import workflows to a new cluster.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users who configure clusters with insufficient history shards are locked into a suboptimal configuration with no path to migrate existing workflows to properly-configured clusters.",
  "rootCause": "The 'global' namespace flag cannot be changed after namespace creation, and history shard count is immutable, preventing replication setup and shard scaling for existing namespaces.",
  "proposedFix": "Either allow history shards to be scaled up after namespace creation, allow namespaces to be retroactively promoted to global status, or support importing events from one namespace/cluster to another.",
  "workaround": "Route new workflows to a parallel cluster at the application level (not ideal for hobby projects).",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The --promote-global flag exists to convert local namespaces to global, though the user encountered additional issues with adding a second cluster.",
