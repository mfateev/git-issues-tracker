  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot start Temporal Server with MySQL when BINLOG_FORMAT=STATEMENT is set, resulting in startup failure with cryptic error message about binary logging constraints.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal sets default MySQL session isolation to READ_COMMITTED, which is incompatible with BINLOG_FORMAT=STATEMENT. MySQL requires REPEATABLE-READ (or more conservative) isolation level when using STATEMENT binlog format.",
  "proposedFix": "Users can override session isolation via connectAttributes in the persistence configuration to set transaction_isolation to 'REPEATABLE-READ'.",
  "workaround": "Configure connectAttributes in mysql-default and mysql-visibility datastores to override transaction_isolation to 'REPEATABLE-READ', or switch to ROW binlog format.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue closed with proposed solution. STATEMENT binlog is noted as experimental in Temporal, with recommendation to use ROW binlog with READ-COMMITTED instead. This is a user configuration issue rather than a product bug.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Using binlog_format=STATEMENT would require the isolation to be REPEATABLE-READ (or more conservative) else it breaks transactional guarantees.",
