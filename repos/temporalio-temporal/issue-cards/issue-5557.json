  "rootCause": "The query parser was treating hyphens as delimiters and inserting spaces around them, converting 'abc-test' to 'abc - test' which caused the SQL parser to fail.",

  "keyQuote": "It seems that although there is no restriction on using hyphen it is somewhat acting as a delimeter and inserting spaces while filtering.",
