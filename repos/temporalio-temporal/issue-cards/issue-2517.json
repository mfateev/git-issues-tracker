  "userImpact": "Users experience unfair task delivery where backlogged tasks wait indefinitely while new tasks are processed, reducing system efficiency during high load.",
  "rootCause": "Task queue partitioning causes asymmetric backlog distribution between root and leaf partitions, with root partitions processing backlog faster and leaf partitions accumulating heavier/older backlogs. Sync match requests bypass the backlog queue.",
  "proposedFix": "Deliver tasks from backlog first with optional configuration to control the behavior. For users with low/medium traffic, reducing partitions to 1 enables approximate FIFO ordering.",
  "workaround": "Reduce task queue partitions to 1 using dynamic config matching.numTaskqueueWritePartitions and matching.numTaskqueueReadPartitions set to value 1, which provides approximate FIFO ordering for low/medium load task queues.",
  "resolution": "completed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue closed as completed. Solution determined: exact FIFO guaranteed for single-partition task queues; larger task queues achieve FIFOish behavior through balanced partition backlogs by design.",
