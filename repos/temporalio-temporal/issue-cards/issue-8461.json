  "userImpact": "Users deploying self-hosted Temporal on AWS EKS and Azure AKS encounter undocumented configuration gotchas that require workarounds, increasing deployment complexity and time-to-value.",
  "rootCause": "Lack of documented guidance for cloud-specific deployment requirements and constraints (Azure TLS enforcement, missing database extensions, archival support limitations).",
  "proposedFix": "Add comprehensive documentation covering AWS EKS and Azure AKS deployment with specific sections on TLS configuration, database extension requirements (BTREE_GIN for PostgreSQL), and archival support limitations.",
  "workaround": "For Azure TLS requirement: either enable TLS with Azure-managed certificates or disable TLS via Postgres server parameters (require_secure_transport). For visibility store: manually enable BTREE_GIN extension in PostgreSQL.",
