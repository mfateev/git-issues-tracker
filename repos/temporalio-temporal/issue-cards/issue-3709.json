  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently capture and persist workflow/activity lifecycle events for integration with external systems without querying and transforming Temporal data at runtime.",
  "rootCause": "Current interceptor implementation only fires on subset of events (start/finish) and cannot distinguish between first execution and replay events.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement worker-level listener/observer that captures all lifecycle events with replay/retry detection capability, similar to existing interceptor pattern but more comprehensive.",
  "workaround": "Use existing interceptors (limited to start/finish events) or gRPC proxy approach (not available in Java SDK and incomplete for server-side completions like timeout/termination).",
