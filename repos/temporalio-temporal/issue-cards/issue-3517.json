  "proposedFix": "Return a list of all previous Failures in PollActivityTaskQueueResponse or make failure history available in Activity Context so workers can access it.",
  "workaround": "Activity can use a Client to describe the workflow and check pendingActivities.lastFailure, though this only provides the last failure, not full history.",
