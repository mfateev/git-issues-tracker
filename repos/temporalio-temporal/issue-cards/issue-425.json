  "userImpact": "After scaling a single-node cluster to multi-node, users experience excessive warning logs that obscure other important information and suggest underlying cluster coordination issues.",
  "rootCause": "Likely related to how shard timers are managed when a new node joins the cluster; the new node may trigger timer reallocations that are out of sync with the original node's read level.",
  "proposedFix": "Ensure services are deployed as one service per host rather than all services in one container; issue may also be related to PR #915 regarding metrics client instantiation per deployment.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Issue resolved when services were deployed to dedicated docker containers/pods rather than all services on the same host. Related to PR #915 which ensures one metrics client per deployment.",
