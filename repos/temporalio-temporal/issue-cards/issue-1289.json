  "userImpact": "Workflows receiving frequent signals cannot safely use continue-as-new without hitting history size limits or signal limits, forcing users to implement complex signal carryover logic.",
  "rootCause": "Task failure on signal receipt during continue-as-new command creation forces workflow replay, and repeated signals prevent completion of continue-as-new execution.",
