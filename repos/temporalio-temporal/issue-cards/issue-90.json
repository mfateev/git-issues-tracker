  "summary": "Default values for EventId and Version fields were changed to EmptyEventID and EmptyVersion constants, but this is error-prone since new objects require explicit setting. Proposal to change constant values to 0, which would serve as a proper 'unset' indicator for EventIds (which start at 1), pending verification that Versions also start at 1.",
