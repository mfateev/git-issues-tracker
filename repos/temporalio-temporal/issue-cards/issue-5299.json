  "userImpact": "Users running Temporal in Kubernetes with rotating database credentials experience silent failures and manual pod restarts instead of automatic recovery.",
  "rootCause": "Liveness probes do not verify database connectivity, so pods with invalid credentials continue running and log errors without triggering automatic restart.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement database connectivity checks within the existing liveness probe to detect authentication failures and trigger pod restarts.",
  "workaround": "Manually restart pods or use tctl namespace list, though tctl cannot connect to localhost even with correct port configuration.",
