  "summary": "Docker container is considered ready by the orchestration system before Temporal services have finished warming up, causing connection failures. The request is to implement a HEALTHCHECK directive in the Dockerfile to signal readiness only after services are fully initialized.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users deploying Temporal in Docker-based environments experience race conditions where clients connect before the server is ready, leading to cascading failures.",
  "rootCause": "Docker assumes container is ready when it starts running, but Temporal engine requires additional warmup time before accepting connections.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement the HEALTHCHECK directive in Dockerfile(s) to verify backend readiness before marking container as healthy.",
  "workaround": "Add HEALTHCHECK to docker-compose files using tctl commands (cluster h, workflow list) to verify service readiness, or use depends_on with service_healthy condition.",

  "keyQuote": "Currently docker will assume the container is ready once it is running, while the temporal engine is still warming up, leading to all sorts of problems.",
