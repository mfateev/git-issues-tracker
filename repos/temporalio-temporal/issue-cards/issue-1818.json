  "rootCause": "The condition `if nowUTC.Before(scheduledUTCTime)` in PR #560 caused nextScheduleTime to be set incorrectly, leading to immediate re-dispatch when scheduledUTCTime was set to a future value that was actually in the past relative to the next scheduled execution.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed in patch release 1.11.4 which included two fixes to cron scheduling logic.",
