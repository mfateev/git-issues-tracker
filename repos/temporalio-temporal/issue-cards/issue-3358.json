  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably determine whether an activity has sent heartbeats, as the LastHeartbeatUpdateTime field is misleading for activities that never heartbeat.",
  "rootCause": "In mutable_state_impl.go around line 2049, LastHeartbeatUpdateTime is being set to StartTime instead of remaining nil for activities that have never heartbeat.",

  "keyQuote": "For activity that never heartbeat, if you DescribeWorkflow the PendingActivity will have LastHeartbeatUpdateTime set to same value as StartTime. It should be nil if it never received a heartbeat.",
