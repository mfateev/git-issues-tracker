  "userImpact": "Users need built-in support for different load balancing strategies when connecting to Temporal frontend servers.",
  "rootCause": "Migration from YARPC to gRPC removed the flexible DispatcherProvider mechanism, replacing it with simple host:port connections without load balancing support.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement gRPC load balancer support using service configs with round-robin configuration and dns:/// prefix for addresses, with pluggable architecture for custom load balancers.",
  "workaround": "Use grpc.Dial with WithDefaultServiceConfig and dns:/// prefix: `grpc.Dial(address, grpc.WithInsecure(), grpc.WithDisableServiceConfig(), grpc.WithDefaultServiceConfig(`{\"loadBalancingConfig\": [{\"round_robin\":{}}]}`))",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Load balancing support was implemented for gRPC frontend connections with proper service config and round-robin support.",

  "keyQuote": "gRPC has support for round robin and custom load balancers as well as service configs. These approaches need to be investigated and Temporal should provide flexible plugable mechanism.",
