  "summary": "User attempted to create a one-time schedule using only `start_at` without an interval or calendar spec, expecting it to trigger once. The schedule was created successfully but the workflow never executed. The root cause was a misunderstanding of the API—`start_at` and `end_at` only set bounds, not the actual trigger times.",

  "userImpact": "Users may create schedules that appear valid but never execute, leading to confusion about API behavior.",
  "rootCause": "User misunderstood that `start_at`/`end_at` only set temporal bounds; an actual interval or calendar spec is required to define matching times.",
  "proposedFix": "Use a calendar spec that matches a single timestamp for one-time schedules, or use the delayed start feature on workflows directly.",
  "workaround": "For one-time schedules, use the delayed start feature on workflows instead of the scheduler, which is more efficient.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Not a bug—user misunderstood the API. The schedule requires either an interval or calendar spec to define trigger times; start_at/end_at only bound when matching can occur.",

  "keyQuote": "Start time and end time only set bounds on allowed matching times. You still need either an interval or calendar spec to actually set the time(s) to match.",
