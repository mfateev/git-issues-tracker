  "rootCause": "YAML unmarshaling with gopkg.in/yaml.v3 does not reject unknown fields by default, allowing invalid configuration to pass silently through the bootstrap code.",
  "proposedFix": "Option 1: Use yaml.Decoder.KnownFields to reject unknown fields and expand validator.v2 usage in config structs, optionally behind a strict-mode flag. Option 2: Migrate to protobuf for configuration specifications with built-in validation.",
