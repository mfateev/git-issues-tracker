  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users needing to serialize workflow executions of the same type must implement complex workarounds instead of using a simple built-in limit mechanism.",
  "rootCause": "Lack of built-in workflow-type level concurrency limiting across the worker pool; current design doesn't provide this feature at the API level.",
  "proposedFix": "Add MaxConcurrentWorkflowsAcrossWorkers option to RegisterWorkflowWithOptions to limit concurrent executions of a workflow type across all workers.",
  "workaround": "Use constant workflow IDs to ensure only one execution per ID, or implement complex mutex-based workflow patterns as described in linked samples and community discussions.",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "An ability to limit the number of parallel workflow executions (of a given type or by some other group like batchId) across all workers is a very frequently requested feature.",
