  "summary": "Activity timeout and retry policy design has fundamental issues: ScheduleToClose timeout conflicts with RetryPolicy.expiration, and activities default to no retries which is counterintuitive. Proposal to redesign timeouts as real intervals, merge retry policy into activity attributes, and make unlimited retries the default with configurable MaximumAttempts.",
