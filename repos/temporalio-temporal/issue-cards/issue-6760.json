  "summary": "Request to include in-memory sync match backlog count in ApproximateBacklogCount metric. Currently, tasks that never reach the durable backlog (such as queries and Nexus tasks) aren't reflected in backlog metrics, limiting visibility for autoscaling decisions in high sync match scenarios.",
