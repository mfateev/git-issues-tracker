  "summary": "Temporal Server/Cassandra tools discover and connect to all Cassandra nodes returned by seed nodes, but some discovered nodes may be unreachable due to network policies in multi-datacenter setups. Users need the ability to restrict connections to only specified seed nodes or nodes in a specific datacenter to comply with regulatory requirements.",

  "userImpact": "Users in regulated multi-datacenter environments cannot use Temporal with managed Cassandra services due to unwanted cross-datacenter connection attempts.",
  "rootCause": "The cqlclient does not expose the Datacenter filtering knob available in the cassandraCluster configuration, causing the gocql library to attempt connections to all discovered nodes regardless of datacenter restrictions.",
