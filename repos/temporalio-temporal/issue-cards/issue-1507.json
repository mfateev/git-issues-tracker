  "summary": "Request for priority task queues to allow prioritizing high-priority tasks while maintaining fair scheduling across workers. Current implementation in v1.28.0 only supports priority within a single queue but doesn't address prioritizing in-progress workflows over new ones when worker capacity is limited.",

  "userImpact": "Users running high-volume workflows with limited worker capacity struggle to ensure fair scheduling and prevent resource monopolization by large workflow batches, resulting in cascading workflow stagnation.",
  "rootCause": "Task queues lack sophisticated priority scheduling that balances task prioritization with fairness guarantees across different workflow sources or execution states.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement priority task queues that order tasks by priority while ensuring fair worker allocation; consider mechanisms to prioritize in-progress workflows over new ones.",
  "workaround": "Manually throttling workflow starts using external queues and monitoring capacity, though this is difficult to implement correctly due to variable data size and load.",
