  "userImpact": "MySQL users cannot remediate database bloat from cascading workflows, forcing degraded service or manual database manipulation with risk of inconsistency.",
  "rootCause": "The tctl admin workflow delete command set only supports Cassandra persistence, not MySQL, creating an operational gap for MySQL deployments.",
  "proposedFix": "Support MySQL in tctl admin workflow commands, or add ability to delete workflows by namespace and time window, or add namespace deletion capability for MySQL.",
  "workaround": "Manually delete rows from executions_visibility table (risky), or reduce namespace retention to accelerate cleanup (causes degraded service for 24+ hours).",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "tctl was refactored to connect via temporal frontend instead of directly to database, making it agnostic to persistence layer.",

  "keyQuote": "tctl now does not connect to database directly and all operation is via temporal frontend. In other word, tctl now supports all temporal's persistence layer.",
