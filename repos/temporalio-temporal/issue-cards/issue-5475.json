  "userImpact": "Users cannot view workflow data in the Temporal UI despite data being successfully written to Elasticsearch.",
  "rootCause": "The Elasticsearch index template is hardcoded to expect indices with a prefix of `temporal_visibility_v1`, but users may configure different index names that don't match this pattern.",
  "proposedFix": "Change the Elasticsearch index name to follow the `temporal_visibility_v1` prefix pattern, or make the index template pattern configurable.",
  "workaround": "Rename the Elasticsearch index to use the `temporal_visibility_v1` prefix (e.g., `temporal_visibility_v1_dev`).",
