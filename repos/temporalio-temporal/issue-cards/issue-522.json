  "summary": "The Authorizer interface is too simplistic for multi-tenant cluster operators who need to enforce fine-grained authorization policies, including restricting namespace visibility and admin operations. Users want richer context to make authorization decisions beyond just API name and namespace name.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Multi-tenant cluster operators cannot implement required authorization policies without brittle workarounds or maintaining forks of the upstream code.",
  "rootCause": "The Authorize interface only provides API name and target namespace as context for authorization decisions, lacking support for per-namespace user roles and result filtering.",
  "proposedFix": "Extend authorization.Result to include AuthorizedNamespaces field and support per-namespace user roles with ClaimMapper to filter results for APIs like ListNamespaces.",
  "workaround": "Implement custom AccessControlledWorkflowHandler or maintain a fork of upstream temporal code to perform post-filtering of results.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Refactored authorization mechanism with Authorizer and ClaimMapper now supports per-namespace user roles and system-level roles. ListNamespaces filtering remains as separate limitation.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The only information we have to go on to make a Deny/Allow decision is whatever credentials we find in the context along with the name of the API call",
