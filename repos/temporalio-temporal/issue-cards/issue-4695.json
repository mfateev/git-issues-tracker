  "userImpact": "Users with Elasticsearch clusters using TLS certificates cannot connect their Temporal Server, blocking visibility into workflow history.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal Server's Elasticsearch HTTP client does not properly handle or validate TLS certificates from known issuers (Let's Encrypt), requiring custom HTTP client configuration to disable certificate verification.",
  "proposedFix": "The Temporal Server should either support certificate configuration in the server config YAML or provide better error messages. Alternatively, implement proper TLS certificate validation for standard certificate authorities.",
  "workaround": "Create a custom HTTP client with InsecureSkipVerify set to true and pass it via temporal.WithElasticsearchHttpClient() when instantiating the server.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Community discovered workaround of using custom HTTP client with InsecureSkipVerify. Issue likely resolved by documentation update or server code fix supporting proper TLS configuration.",
