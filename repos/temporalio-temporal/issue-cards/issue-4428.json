  "summary": "Feature request to support absolute deadline timers instead of relative delays. Currently, timers use relative delays (e.g., '10s'), but network transit and persistence lag cause actual delays to exceed the specified time. The proposal is to allow specifying deadlines as absolute timestamps/ISO strings.",
