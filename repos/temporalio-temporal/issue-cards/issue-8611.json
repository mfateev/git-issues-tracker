  "summary": "Request to allow workflows to specify benign error exhaustion thresholds for activities, enabling suppression of error logs and metrics for the first N retry attempts while treating subsequent failures as non-benign. This allows activities that poll services to avoid noisy error reporting during expected retry periods.",

  "userImpact": "Developers cannot currently suppress error logs and metrics for expected activity retries when polling services, requiring workarounds with context propagators and interceptors.",
  "rootCause": "Activity benign error classification is controlled at the activity level, not at the activity invocation site in the workflow, preventing flexible per-call configuration of error handling behavior.",
  "proposedFix": "Add benign exhaustion threshold configuration to ActivityOptions alongside retry policy, with server-side or interceptor-based logic to classify exceptions as BENIGN until thresholds are breached.",
  "workaround": "Use ContextPropagator and WorkflowThreadLocal to pass benign retry policy from workflow to activity, with activity-side interceptor transforming exceptions to BENIGN when under thresholds.",
