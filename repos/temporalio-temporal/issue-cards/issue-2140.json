  "userImpact": "Users cannot reset workflows multiple times as subsequent reset requests silently fail due to empty requestId deduplication, breaking expected idempotent behavior.",
  "rootCause": "Server deduplicates requests based on requestId, treating empty/null requestId as a valid deduplication key rather than disabling deduplication or requiring a unique ID.",
  "proposedFix": "Either make requestId mandatory, generate random IDs for empty requestId, skip deduplication for empty requestId, or error on empty requestId requests.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was identified as a bug in the reset workflow execution deduplication logic and addressed in the codebase.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "resetWorkflowExecution is idempotent and duplicate requests with the same requestId is getting ignored, including an empty one. Such a request will work right at the first invocation, which makes the problem even hard to catch.",
