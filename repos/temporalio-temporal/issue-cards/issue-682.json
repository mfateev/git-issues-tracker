  "summary": "Workflows cannot signal themselves, throwing UnknownExternalWorkflowExecution error. Users request this capability as an enhancement for metrics tracking and signal-driven architecture patterns, though the server currently prevents it due to implementation constraints (deadlock risk from locking).",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot use self-signaling for metrics tracking or architectural patterns requiring workflows to signal themselves, forcing workarounds like local channels.",
  "rootCause": "Server's signal command processing holds a lock on source execution while writing to target execution; same source/target causes deadlock, so server blocks self-signals as a protection mechanism.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement safe self-signaling support to allow workflows to signal themselves without causing deadlocks; suggested improvement: better error message (WorkflowCantSignalItself instead of UnknownExternalWorkflowExecution).",
  "workaround": "Use local workflow channels to pipe signals instead of SignalExternalWorkflow for self-signals.",
