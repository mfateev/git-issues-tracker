  "userImpact": "Operators experience noisy logs during routine deployments that obscure real issues, making it difficult to distinguish deployment errors from operational problems.",
  "rootCause": "During rolling bounces/upgrades, shard rebalancing causes predictable transient errors (shard stealing, ack level updates, queue state updates) that are not indicative of actual problems.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement throttling of expected transient errors during ring changes or shard rebalancing, either by: (1) suppressing/downgrading messages to warnings with a counter, or (2) detecting rebalance events and temporarily reducing error log levels.",
  "workaround": "Manual monitoring systems that ignore a baseline level of these errors during deployments based on historical deployment patterns.",

  "keyQuote": "Ideally, we should be able to do a rolling bounce or rolling upgrade of Temporal without encountering these errors on a routine basis.",
