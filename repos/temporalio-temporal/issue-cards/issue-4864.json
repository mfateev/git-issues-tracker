  "rootCause": "The worker service cannot obtain a valid JWT token that passes authorization checks when connecting with the default claimMapper configuration.",
  "proposedFix": "Use internal-frontend configuration so the worker connects to a different frontend that doesn't check JWT, as documented in the 1.20.0 release notes.",

  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "No direct fix provided. The issue is a configuration limitation where there's no easy way for the worker role to pass a JWT accepted by the frontend. The recommended solution is architectural - use internal-frontend.",
