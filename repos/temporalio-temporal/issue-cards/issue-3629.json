  "summary": "The auto-setup container fails to connect to the Temporal server when binding to IPv6 addresses because the IPv6 address format (with brackets) is not preserved during connection setup. The brackets are needed in IPv6 addresses with ports but are being stripped, causing \"too many colons in address\" errors.",
