This would reduce persistence overhead and infrastructure costs by batching writes while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.",

  "userImpact": "Users could reduce persistence infrastructure costs and improve workflow execution performance by leveraging a tiered storage approach with real-time caching and eventual consistency.",
  "rootCause": "Current Temporal design requires immediate writes to persistence store for all events and activity results, preventing batching optimizations and increasing infrastructure costs.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement hybrid architecture: Redis for hot/active workflow state with eviction policies, Kafka for durable event log and replay capability, Cassandra for long-term storage with periodic batch writes from Redis.",
