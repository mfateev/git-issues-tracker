Currently, each namespace requires an individual configuration entry; the request proposes allowing patterns like 'stg-*' to apply rules to multiple namespaces matching that pattern.",

  "userImpact": "Users managing multiple namespaces with similar rate-limiting rules must currently update the server configuration for each new namespace instead of using a single wildcard pattern.",

  "proposedFix": "Add wildcard pattern support (e.g., 'stg-*', 'prod-*') to namespace constraints in the frontend.namespacerps configuration, allowing rules to apply to all matching namespaces.",

  "keyQuote": "It would be useful to be able to define wildcard rules that get applied to namespaces (e.g. `stg-*` means any namespaces matching this rule such as `stg-test` will have this rule applied to it).",
