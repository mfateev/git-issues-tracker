  "rootCause": "run_id is generated at workflow start time, not ahead of time, so it cannot be prepopulated for future scheduled executions.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a new field parallel to future_action_time that includes the scheduled time without jitter applied, allowing clients to derive the workflow_id (which includes timestamp) for future executions.",
  "workaround": "Use workflow_id prefix + start time or TemporalScheduledStartTime search attribute to identify future executions, though this doesn't include run_id.",
