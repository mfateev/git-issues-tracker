  "userImpact": "Users cannot use Elasticsearch with username/password authentication in Docker auto-setup, forcing them to implement custom workarounds for Kubernetes deployments.",
  "rootCause": "The curl commands in docker/start.sh scripts do not include username and password parameters when connecting to Elasticsearch, and the frontend container polling logic also lacks authentication support.",
  "proposedFix": "Update the curl commands in docker/start.sh to support username and password parameters for Elasticsearch authentication.",
  "workaround": "Mount a modified Elasticsearch setup script in a Kubernetes init container and change the frontend container command to use ./start-temporal.sh instead of the default startup command.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Elasticsearch setup was refactored to run only in the auto-setup image, and a Kubernetes server job was created for index creation that supports authentication in production environments.",
