  "summary": "Make it easier to export workflow history in JSON format from tctl by adding an explicit --output_format flag instead of relying on undiscovered --output_filename parameter. The current approach is not user-discoverable and lacks support for human-readable formatting of base64-encoded payload data.",

  "userImpact": "Users struggle to discover and use JSON export functionality for workflow history, making it difficult to analyze workflows and use tctl in containerized environments.",
  "rootCause": "The --output_filename parameter is not documented in tctl help, and exported JSON contains base64-encoded payload data that is not human-readable.",
  "proposedFix": "Replace --print_full flag with --output_format flag supporting values like 'short', 'full', 'json', and potentially add decoding of base64-encoded payload data for human readability.",
  "workaround": "Use --output_filename parameter with workflow show command to save history as JSON file.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "A unified --output flag was added in temporalio/proposals#31 and implemented in tctl repo to apply consistently across all commands that print golang structs.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Explicit flag that specifies output format. I would replace `--print_full` flag with `--outuput_format` that can be `short`, `full`, `json`, etc.",
