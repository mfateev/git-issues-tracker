  "summary": "Operators need namespace-level rate limiting controls that align with SDK-centric metrics (workflows/s, activities/s, signals/s, timers/s) rather than low-level system metrics like persistence QPS or frontend RPS. Current rate limiting options lack the granularity needed for per-namespace enforcement based on projected user loads.",

  "userImpact": "Operators cannot effectively enforce user-defined load limits at the namespace level, forcing them to translate SDK-centric load projections into low-level system metrics that don't directly correspond to user requirements.",
  "rootCause": "Rate limiting controls are implemented at low system levels (persistence, frontend RPS) rather than at the namespace level with SDK-centric metrics abstraction.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement namespace-level rate limiting controls that directly support SDK-centric metrics: workflows/s, activities/s, signals/s, and timers/s per namespace.",
  "workaround": "Use existing controls like frontend.namespaceRPS or frontend.globalNamespaceRPS, though these lack the granularity needed for SDK-centric load projections.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Comments indicate frontend.globalNamespaceRPS was identified as a per-namespace rate limit option that addresses the core need, though with acknowledged limitations on granularity.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "It would be ideal if the system offered direct control on the rates of these SDK-centric events, at the namespace level.",
