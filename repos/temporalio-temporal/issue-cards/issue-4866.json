  "summary": "Schedule updates incorrectly discard previously scheduled actions when the update occurs between the nominal and jittered time. A scheduled action with jitter (e.g., 12:20:33) is lost if the schedule is updated at 12:20:10, as the calculation restarts from the update time instead of from the previous action time.",
