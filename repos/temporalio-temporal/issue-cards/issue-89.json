  "rootCause": "Current `reason` and `details` fields use language-specific serialization formats (Java, Python, Go) making cross-language error handling impossible.",
  "proposedFix": "Introduce generic protobuf structures: ApplicationFailureInfo with language identifier, Failure with failureInfo oneof, and FailureChain to represent error chains with stacktraces.",
