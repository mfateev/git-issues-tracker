  "summary": "Add built-in support for read-only user roles in Temporal, including API categorization and UI enforcement. Currently, operators must write custom authorizers to enforce read-only access, but the framework should provide out-of-the-box support with API categorization into ReadOnly/ReadWrite/Admin categories.",
