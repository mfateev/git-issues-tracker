  "rootCause": "Missing visibility mechanism to determine which workflow versions are still actively running and require worker support.",
  "proposedFix": "Add BuildIDs search attribute (preferably with ES alias support), combine with version graph data, and potentially create new API or augment GetWorkerBuildIDOrdering to determine worker retirement eligibility.",

  "keyQuote": "We need a way for users to be able to understand when a set of workers can be retired because no more workflows require the version those workers support.",
