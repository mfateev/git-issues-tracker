  "userImpact": "Users cannot isolate Temporal data using PostgreSQL schemas, limiting database organization and preventing proper schema-based access control in multi-tenant or restricted-permission environments.",
  "rootCause": "The sql-tool does not support defining or creating custom schemas; it relies on default public schema and lacks schema name configuration as a property.",
  "proposedFix": "Add schema name as a configurable property in sql-tool, support CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS statement during initialization, and optionally set search_path automatically based on configuration.",
  "workaround": "Manually create schema and set search_path via ALTER ROLE, provided Temporal doesn't hardcode references to public schema.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Define the schema name as a property (for templating the above query) and put the CREATE statement after CREATE DATABASE with IF NOT EXISTS checks.",
