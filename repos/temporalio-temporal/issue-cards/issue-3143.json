  "summary": "Request to add new per-taskqueue metrics with improved naming and labeling. Current metrics use deprecated 'per_tl' naming and inconsistent taskqueue labels, making it difficult to aggregate metrics across partitions. Proposal is to add '_per_taskqueue' metrics with root taskqueue labels and partition indicators.",
