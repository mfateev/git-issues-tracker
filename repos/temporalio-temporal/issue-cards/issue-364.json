  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably terminate child workflows that use continue-as-new, breaking the parent-child workflow lifecycle management.",
  "rootCause": "The terminate request uses the RunID of the child workflow, which becomes invalid after continue-as-new creates a new execution. The correct RunID should be the first workflow in the continue-as-new chain.",
  "proposedFix": "Either change the semantic of RunID in the terminate request to reference the first workflow in the continue-as-new chain, or introduce a new parameter to handle this case.",
