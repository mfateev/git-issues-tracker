  "summary": "Feature request to separate read and write QPS limits for persistence operations. Currently, a single combined QPS limit causes issues where read-heavy operations like Schedule API queries and UI browsing fail due to persistence throttling, even though reads are less costly than writes.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot access schedules via UI when persistence QPS limits are hit by read-heavy operations, limiting the usability of schedule management features.",
  "rootCause": "A single DescribeSchedule request generates 5-20+ persistence read calls in burst (GetCurrentExecution, GetWorkflowExecution, ReadHistoryBranch, etc.), which are treated the same as write operations under a combined QPS limit, causing read-heavy workloads to exceed the limit.",
  "proposedFix": "Introduce separate QPS configuration parameters: history.persistenceNamespaceReadMaxQPS and history.persistenceNamespaceWriteMaxQPS to allow independent rate limiting based on operation type.",
  "workaround": "Increase the namespace QPS quota to accommodate read-heavy schedule operations.",
