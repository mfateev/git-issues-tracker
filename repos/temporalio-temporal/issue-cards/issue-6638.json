  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users are unable to terminate workflows that have accumulated large buffered events, blocking workflow cleanup and potentially blocking system resources.",
  "rootCause": "Buffered events in workflow execution grow too large (>4MB), causing UpdateWorkflowExecution transaction to fail when termination attempts to flush events, preventing workflow termination.",
  "proposedFix": "Prevent buffered events from growing larger than 2MB to avoid exceeding transaction size limit during termination.",
  "workaround": "Temporarily increase system.transactionSizeLimit configuration value to allow termination to proceed, or delete workflow using temporal CLI which doesn't enforce size limit.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue closed due to inactivity. Fix implemented in later releases to prevent buffered events from exceeding 2MB limit.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "I am guessing there are too many buffered events in the workflow which exceeds the 4MB and can't be flushed upon workflow termination.",
