  "summary": "The `tctl workflow list` command with `ExecutionStatus=1` query returns inconsistent results when run repeatedly - sometimes showing an empty list and sometimes returning completed workflows that should not match the query. The issue is that completed workflows are appearing in results for a query that should only return running workflows.",
