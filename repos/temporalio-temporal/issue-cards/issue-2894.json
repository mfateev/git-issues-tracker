  "summary": "Feature request to allow historyArchiver and visibilityArchiver to read AWS credentials from a file path instead of relying solely on global environment variables, improving security and supporting Kubernetes workloads with mounted secrets.",

  "apis": [],

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users running Temporal on Kubernetes or shared EC2 instances cannot securely pass AWS credentials to archiving components without exposing them globally.",
  "rootCause": "Archivers only support global AWS credentials via environment variables or instance profiles, not credential files, limiting deployment options.",
  "proposedFix": "Add first lookup on AWS secret from a file path before falling back to global environment variables, AWS profiles, or instance profiles.",
  "workaround": "Set the AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable to specify a credential file location, following AWS SDK best practices.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as the requested functionality is already available through standard AWS SDK environment variables (AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE), following AWS best practices.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "I think you can just set the AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE environment variable if you want to specify a specific file.",
