  "userImpact": "Users requiring manual control over activity execution (e.g., production deployment gates) would need to use signals as a workaround.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Signals can be used as a workaround: workflow waits on a signal channel, and users trigger activity execution by sending a signal via API.",
  "workaround": "Use signal channels to implement manual control: workflows wait on signals, and users send signals via the Temporal API or tctl when ready to proceed.",

  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was addressed through guidance that the existing signals mechanism already provides the requested functionality, making a dedicated feature unnecessary.",
