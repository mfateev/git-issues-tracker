  "userImpact": "Child workflows fail permanently instead of retrying when retry policy is configured but maximumAttempts is 0, requiring workarounds by setting explicit attempt counts.",
  "rootCause": "Server does not apply intelligent defaults for retry policy fields when maximumAttempts is 0 or unset; client SDK defaults like BackoffCoefficient are not consistently applied.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement intelligent defaults for ChildWorkflowOptions on the server side; remove client SDK defaults like BackoffCoefficient=2 and rely on server settings instead.",
