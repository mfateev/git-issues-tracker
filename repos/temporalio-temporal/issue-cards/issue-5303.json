  "summary": "When signaling a closed workflow, the API throws an error without indicating whether the workflow is truly non-existent or simply closed. The request is to include WorkflowStatus in the error response to allow applications to handle these two cases differently without requiring a separate DescribeWorkflowExecution API call.",
