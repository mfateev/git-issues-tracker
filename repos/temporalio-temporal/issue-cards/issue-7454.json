  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Windows users cannot use the update-schema command, blocking schema migrations on Windows environments.",
  "rootCause": "filepath.Join() returns backslash-separated paths on Windows (e.g., v1.0\\manifest.json) which fs.ReadFile() cannot process; the fs package expects forward slashes regardless of OS.",
  "proposedFix": "Replace filepath.Join() with path.Join() in updatetask.go to ensure forward-slash paths that work with fs.ReadFile() across all platforms.",
  "workaround": "Manually edit paths or use workaround by specifying paths with forward slashes, though not practical for Windows users.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The maintainer confirmed the fix using path.Join() resolves the issue by aligning with Go's embed stdlib behavior, which does not consider OS-specific paths.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "On windows, filepath.Join() returns a path with \"\\\\\" as the separator and paths like this don't work with fs.ReadFile()",
