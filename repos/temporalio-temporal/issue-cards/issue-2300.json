  "userImpact": "Users cannot query workflows during scheduled/retrying states, limiting the ability to inspect workflow state before execution begins.",
  "rootCause": "SDKs expect workflows to be started before handling queries because query handlers are registered during the workflow event loop. For scheduled/retried workflows, this loop hasn't executed yet.",
  "proposedFix": "Add QUERY_RESULT_TYPE_AWAITING_EXECUTION enum to QueryResultType and have server return a typed error. Alternatively, allow static queries to register ahead of time so they can answer for workflows with zero completed workflow tasks.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Duplicate of issue #1310. Discussion evolved to consider allowing static queries for workflows with zero completed tasks rather than just returning an error.",
