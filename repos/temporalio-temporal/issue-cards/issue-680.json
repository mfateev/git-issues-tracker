  "userImpact": "Users cannot elegantly coordinate with independently-started workflows from within a parent workflow, forcing workarounds like polling activities or using Nexus handlers.",
  "rootCause": "The Temporal workflow engine lacks native support for waiting on external workflow completion within workflow code; currently only child workflows (parent-started) and external client polling are supported.",
  "proposedFix": "Add WaitForExternalWorkflowCompletion decision, corresponding ExternalWorkflowCompleted/Failed/Cancelled/Terminated/TimedOut events, and WaitForExternalWorkflowCompletionFailed event.",
  "workaround": "Use an 'infinite activity' that executes the client-side workflow.execute() with USE_EXISTING conflict policy and heartbeats to track progress, or use Nexus WorkflowRunOperation for looser coupling.",
