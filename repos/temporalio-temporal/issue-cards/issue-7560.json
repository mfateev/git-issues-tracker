  "userImpact": "Users can configure JWT permission parsing with regex patterns instead of maintaining custom authorization plugins, simplifying self-hosted Temporal deployments.",
  "rootCause": "Default JWT claim mapper only supports hardcoded namespace:role format, requiring custom plugins when issuers use different claim structures.",
  "proposedFix": "Add PermissionsPattern configuration to Authorization Config that uses regex with named groups (namespace, role) to extract permissions, with fallback to original behavior when not configured.",
  "workaround": "Maintain a custom authorization plugin, though this requires custom build, additional CI/CD steps, and Docker image management.",
