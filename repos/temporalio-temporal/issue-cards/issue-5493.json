  "rootCause": "Event reapplication during reset groups all reapplied events into a single batch without checking against the 4MB persistence layer size limit.",
  "proposedFix": "Approach 1: Automatically track event batch size in history builder code and create new batches when limit is exceeded. Approach 2: Make this reset-specific by tracking reapplied event size and calling a history builder method to create new batches.",
