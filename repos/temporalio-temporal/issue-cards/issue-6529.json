  "summary": "Certificate-filters functionality is currently only available in Temporal Cloud but not in self-hosted deployments. This feature request asks for implementing certificate-based access control in on-prem environments to maintain security feature parity and address the limitation that self-hosted users lack similar security capabilities.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Self-hosted Temporal users cannot enforce certificate-based access restrictions, limiting their ability to implement the same security controls available to cloud users.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Implement a custom claim mapper (similar to myClaimMapper.go) that reads from a certificate-filters file and enforces restrictions based on certificate attributes, or provide native certificate-filter support in self-hosted version.",
  "workaround": "Use an nginx gRPC proxy with certificate-based access control at the network level, though this adds complexity compared to a native solution.",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "It would be beneficial to have this functionality available in the self-hosted version as well, as it's frustrating for users running on-prem environments to lack similar security features.",
