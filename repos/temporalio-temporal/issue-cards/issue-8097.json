  "summary": "Currently, incoming signals are rejected when a workflow attempts continueAsNew but fails due to buffered signals, preventing infinite loops. The feature request proposes flushing buffered signals to the new run instead of the current run, allowing continueAsNew to succeed without rejecting signals.",
