  "userImpact": "Users running Temporal with Elasticsearch 8.x experience excessive error logs cluttering production monitoring and alerting systems, making it difficult to identify genuine issues.",
  "rootCause": "The olivere/elastic/v7 client library continues to send deprecated Elasticsearch parameters (include_upper) that trigger deprecation warnings in Elasticsearch 8.x, which are logged at error level instead of being suppressed or downgraded.",
  "proposedFix": "Update Temporal to use the latest Elasticsearch APIs compatible with version 8.x, or filter/downgrade deprecation warning log levels from Elasticsearch to avoid error-level noise.",
  "workaround": "Configure Elasticsearch cluster settings to set logger.org.elasticsearch.deprecation to ERROR level to suppress deprecation warnings.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "User resolved the issue on their end by configuring Elasticsearch to suppress deprecation warnings, but the underlying problem of using deprecated APIs remains unresolved by the Temporal team.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "I hope that in the future, Temporal will be patched to use the latest APIs instead of deprecated ones, depending on the Elasticsearch version.",
