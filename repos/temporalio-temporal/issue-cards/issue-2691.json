  "summary": "Request to extend Temporal server APIs to support 'chain_start_run_id' as an alternative to 'run_id' for addressing the latest run in a workflow execution chain. This allows users to continue interacting with runs in the same logical workflow chain without accidentally switching to a new chain when the same workflow ID is reused.",
