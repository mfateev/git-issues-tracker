  "userImpact": "Users needing month-end recurring tasks must manually specify 12 different calendar specs or use workarounds instead of a single flexible schedule configuration.",
  "rootCause": "The ScheduleCalendarSpec day_of_month parameter only accepts fixed values 1-31 and cannot represent variable month-end dates.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow a special value like 31 or -1 in day_of_month to match the last day of any month regardless of how many days that month contains.",
  "workaround": "Assemble a list of calendar specs, one per month, with explicitly provided last days for each month (but does not work for indefinite schedules).",

  "keyQuote": "Because the last day of the month changes month to month, there isn't currently a temporal schedule configuration which supports this.",
