  "rootCause": "Reset and update operations are not atomic, allowing the workflow to execute with stale state between the reset and update application.",

  "keyQuote": "There could be a race that when the code rely on the updated state after reset immediately, but the update request is not guaranteed to be applied atomically with reset",
