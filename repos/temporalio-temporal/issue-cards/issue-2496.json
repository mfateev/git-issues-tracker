  "summary": "Request to allow customization of activity retry behavior for timeout errors. Currently the server has hardcoded retry logic where heartbeat and start-to-close timeouts are retryable, but other timeout types are not. The proposed solution is to use the non-retryable errors field in activity retry policy to customize this behavior.",
