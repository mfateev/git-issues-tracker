  "rootCause": "The download link is a facade to GitHub releases that serves a tarball, but the documentation doesn't indicate this requires extraction before execution.",

  "keyQuote": "While it shouldn't, it's just a facade to the GitHub releases area. If you want a stable link, use a link from GitHub directly",
