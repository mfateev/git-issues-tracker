  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users deploying in restricted Kubernetes environments must manually configure additional security context settings instead of relying on consistent numeric UIDs/GIDs in images.",
  "rootCause": "Docker images use inconsistent numeric UIDs/GIDs (web container uses 5000, others use different values) or username-based UIDs that Kubernetes cannot automatically detect.",
  "proposedFix": "Use the same integer UID/GID across all Temporal docker images for consistent Kubernetes security policy detection.",
  "workaround": "Manually define securityContext in Kubernetes manifests with explicit runAsUser and runAsGroup values (e.g., 1000).",

  "keyQuote": "If the UIDs were not 0, I could leave off at least the last two items. Also, the web container uses 5000 for the temporal user... which is likely an unneeded difference.",
