  "summary": "The CLI 'workflow run' command times out after 2 minutes while polling for workflow completion events, even though the workflow continues executing. The gRPC connection used for history event streaming has a default 2-minute timeout that causes the client to stop polling.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot wait for workflow completion via CLI for long-running workflows without manually specifying a context timeout flag.",
  "rootCause": "The gRPC connection listening to history events has a default 2-minute timeout; when it expires, the client stops making long poll requests even though the workflow continues executing.",
  "proposedFix": "Either change the default context timeout behavior, improve the long polling mechanism to refresh before timeout, or provide better documentation/automatic handling of the --context_timeout flag.",
  "workaround": "Add the --context_timeout flag when running workflows expected to take longer than 2 minutes.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue addressed through improved timeout handling and context management in the CLI workflow run command.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The workflow execution continues regardless of the error, what happens is that the gRPC connection that listens to history events is getting timed out. By default it is set to 2 minutes.",
