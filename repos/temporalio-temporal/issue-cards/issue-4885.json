  "summary": "Replace the confusing signalWithStart API with a clearer signalOrStart alternative that better handles the use case where users want to signal a workflow only if it's not already running, addressing confusion about the 'with' terminology and the race condition where signals can arrive before the workflow starts.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Provides a clearer, more intuitive API for signaling workflows at startup, reducing confusion and preventing race conditions where signals arrive before the workflow method executes.",
  "rootCause": "The signalWithStart API name and semantics are confusing - the 'with' terminology is ambiguous and doesn't clearly convey the intent, plus it requires handling the case where signals arrive before workflow execution.",
  "proposedFix": "Build a new signalOrStart API based on the existing signalWithStart implementation that better represents the semantic intent of 'signal if not already running, otherwise start and signal'.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The feature was not implemented. A commenter noted that adding another API would increase confusion rather than resolve it, and there's no way to deprecate the existing signalWithStart API.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "At this point, adding more API to do the same probably just add more confusion and no way to deprecate existing one.",
