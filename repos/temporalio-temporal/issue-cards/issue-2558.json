  "summary": "Continue as new operations copy over prev_auto_reset_points, potentially causing unbounded growth. The issue was closed as by-design since a MaxAutoResetPoints limit of 20 prevents actual growth, but the reason for copying these points during continue-as-new operations remains unclear.",
