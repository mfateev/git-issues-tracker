  "summary": "Request to add a flag controlling when ParentClosePolicy applies: either on individual run completion or on entire workflow chain completion. Currently, keeping children alive during continue-as-new requires ABANDON policy, which prevents automatic child termination when parent is terminated.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot keep children running across a chain of parent continue-as-new calls while maintaining the ability to terminate all children when the final parent run is terminated.",
  "rootCause": "ParentClosePolicy currently only applies at individual run completion, not at workflow chain completion level.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a `parentClosePolicyScope` flag with options RUN or WORKFLOW_CHAIN that determines the scope of policy application. When set to WORKFLOW_CHAIN, terminating the last run terminates all children from the entire chain, respecting parent retention intervals.",
  "workaround": "Set ParentClosePolicy to ABANDON to keep children running during continue-as-new, but this disables automatic child termination on parent termination.",
