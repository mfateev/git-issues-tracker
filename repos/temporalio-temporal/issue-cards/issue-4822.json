  "userImpact": "Users cannot start Temporal server with MySQL 8 on Linux due to RPC port value exceeding column data type limits.",
  "rootCause": "The rpc_port column in temporal.cluster_membership is defined as smallint (max 32767) but receives values like 52336 from dynamically assigned ports.",
  "proposedFix": "Change rpc_port column type from smallint to smallint unsigned or a larger integer type to accommodate port values up to 65535.",
  "workaround": "Manually configure membershipPort in the config file to use a value within smallint range (below 32767).",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was user error - user had deleted membershipPort from their config file, causing invalid dynamic port assignment.",

  "keyQuote": "param `ringpopHostAddress` is `127.0.0.1:0`. after `tChannel.Serve(listener)`, could get peerInfo, like `127.0.0.1:52336`. then save 52336 to temporal.cluster_membership, column rpc_port, but it's type is `smallint`",
