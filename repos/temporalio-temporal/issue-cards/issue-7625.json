  "summary": "User's self-hosted Temporal cluster experiences database performance degradation every 12 hours due to scavenger cleanup jobs. They request per-job RPS configuration (specifically historyScannerRPS) and potentially configurable cron schedules to allow fine-grained tuning of cleanup operations without impacting overall cluster throughput.",

  "userImpact": "Operators cannot fine-tune database cleanup operations, causing periodic performance degradation and forcing them to globally reduce persistence throughput.",
  "rootCause": "Scavenger jobs lack granular per-job RPS configuration; history scanner relies only on persistenceMaxQPS which affects all persistence operations, and cron schedule is hardcoded.",
  "proposedFix": "Add dynamic configuration field for historyScannerRPS to allow per-job RPS tuning; optionally make the cron schedule configurable with current value as default.",
  "workaround": "Lower the global persistenceMaxQPS setting, though this reduces cluster throughput outside cleanup windows.",
