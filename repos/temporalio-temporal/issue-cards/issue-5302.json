  "summary": "Request to add native YDB (Yandex Database) support as a storage backend for Temporal, allowing developers to leverage YDB's geographic replication, automatic scaling, and fault tolerance features. While a community fork exists, the request is for out-of-the-box YDB support with selectable database storage options.",

  "keyQuote": "This fork is not a 100% functional solution, it would be great to see YDB support in Temporal out of the box. With the option to select DB as storage.",
