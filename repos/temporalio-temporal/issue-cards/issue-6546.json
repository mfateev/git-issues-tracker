  "userImpact": "Users cannot run necessary blocking operations during workflows without triggering panic, forcing them to use workarounds that compromise determinism.",
  "rootCause": "Workflow deadlock detector prevents blocking operations by design to ensure determinism, but legitimate use cases require blocking external functions that cannot be adapted to async patterns.",
  "proposedFix": "Make the deadlock detection disable mechanism public (e.g., making internal functions in workflow_deadlock.go public), or provide an official API to disable deadlock detection for specific scopes.",
  "workaround": "Abuse the DataConverterWithoutDeadlockDetection by implementing a custom data converter that executes the blocking function in its ToStrings method, though this is non-deterministic.",
