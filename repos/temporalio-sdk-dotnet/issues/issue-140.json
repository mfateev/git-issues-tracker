This would be functionally similar to what already exists in TypeScript SDK, though we may want to consider a solution for .NET where logs are passed directly from core to lang side, without buffering (akin to what has been done for metrics forwarding).\r\n\r\nA corresponding option already exists (as [seen here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/blob/ab4ded44cb15c2aba6ef7472e712ba12f3fef6ad/src/Temporalio/Bridge/src/runtime.rs#L212-L215)) and triggers registration of the Log forwarding export layer in Bridge, but log entries never get polled by lang, so this practically behave as a noop log exporter.","closedAt":"2023-11-14T14:44:09Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs5p-CeV","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I have opened https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/618 which this will depend on because we'd surely want this push based in .NET where there is not as much FFI overhead as there is in other languages.
