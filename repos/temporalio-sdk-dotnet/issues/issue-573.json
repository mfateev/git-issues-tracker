We should offer an option on the `CustomMetricMeter` that will put calls to the underlying `Meter` inside `Workflow.Unsafe.WithTracingEventListenerDisabled` if `Workflow.InWorkflow` is `true`. Whether this option is enabled by default or not is TBD, but probably will be on by default (and therefore would be ok if this wasn't a user-facing option at all).","closedAt":"2025-12-19T16:15:19Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-12-09T17:54:45Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":573,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Allow custom meter implementation to disable tracing event listener","updatedAt":"2025-12-19T16:15:19Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/573"}
