It would significantly simplify things if I could make use of it directly in a Temporal activity vs having to wrap the library in an API that the activity calls out to.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs59fA6u","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The issue with the extra targets (like Windows 32-bit, Windows ARM, Linux MUSL, etc) is that it adds bloat to the package because the NuGet package has to embed the full DLL for that distro/arch. The NuGet package is already 50MB compressed and each shared library we add is ~30MB (~10MB compressed). Also, I am not sure we test for 32-bit.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to build the SDK on 32-bit though and make your own package to depend on. I will leave this open for others to see, because it is possible we may ship a separate NuGet package in the future with 32-bit support. But there are no immediate plans for Windows 32-bit.","createdAt":"2024-05-10T21:17:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/247#issuecomment-2105282222","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-05-10T19:58:29Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":247,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_DOWN","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Support for win-x86","updatedAt":"2024-05-10T21:19:14Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/247"}
