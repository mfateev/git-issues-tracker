Downgrade glibc as old as possible. Ideally manually, but can use just older ubuntu version during build if that helps.","closedAt":"2023-04-19T19:31:40Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-03-10T13:28:19Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7zkA","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":36,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] NuGet package is built with too-new of a glibc version","updatedAt":"2023-04-19T19:31:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/36"}
