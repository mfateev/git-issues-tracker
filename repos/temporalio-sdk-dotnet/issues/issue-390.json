It would be very useful for people that are using F# to have some samples as well since it would lower the barrier of entry if it was not needed to do the translation from C# to F#.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to know if there were any gotchas around using Temporal with F# e.g. is F#'s async a bad idea when using the Temporal SDK?\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs6ZzSqn","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"There is already a sample request open at https://github.com/temporalio/samples-dotnet/issues/10, but we have not prioritized this effort. Some early research showed that you may not be able to use the typesafe lambda expressions, but otherwise it may work. There has not been enough desire for F# to invest in it thus far. Full featured F# support would be more than a sample probably, it'd be a `Temporalio.Extensions.FSharp` package with some helpers I think.","createdAt":"2025-01-09T14:24:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/390#issuecomment-2580359847","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs7BGEU1","author":{"login":"aggieben"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I'm using F# for my backend and workflow definitions.
