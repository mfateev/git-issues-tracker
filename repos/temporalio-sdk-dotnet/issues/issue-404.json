Please describe.\n\nI'd like the latest version of the Cloud Operations API to be included whenever the next version of the .NET SDK is released.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\nThe Cloud Operations API definitions are updated to the latest versions in https://github.com/temporalio/api-cloud\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\nThe current version of the Cloud Operations API included in the .NET SDK is 8 months old: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/tree/b2076604607c3f295b21105386b719782f1dd364/sdk-core-protos/protos/api_cloud_upstream\n\nThere have since been features added. In particular, we are interested in the usage API, as it will allow us to ingest relevant billing and activity usage into some of our business insight tools.\n\nIt is inconvenient (although not impossible) today to use the latest version of the Cloud Operations API in a program that also uses the Temporal .NET SDK. This is because the .NET SDK includes the compiled definitions of the Cloud Operations protobuf messages: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/tree/main/src/Temporalio/Api/Cloud, and so users will run into namespacing conflicts if attempting to compile the Cloud Operations protobufs as-is in the same program. This is more of a protobuf / dotnet problem than a Temporal problem, but the pain point is still there; we can get around this by editing the Cloud Operations protobuf messages and selectively compiling only the portion of the protobuf messages that don't exist in the .NET SDK.\n\nWe don't expect releases of the .NET SDK whenever there is new Cloud Operations functionality added, but it would be nice if the Cloud Operations API definitions could be refreshed during releases of the .NET SDK, similar to how the OSS API definitions are.","closedAt":"2025-02-20T21:38:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs6c3lp0","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We will look into updating this.
