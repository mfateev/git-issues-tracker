So if an error on failure conversion occurs in there, we are not logging it because we are not logging/catching all errors for `QueueNewTaskAsync`.\n\nThis same thing could happen in other places where we are not properly catching errors in tasks passed to `QueueNewTaskAsync`. We need to be catching these and setting `currentActivationException` (and maybe add logging if the existing task failure logging is inadequate). Whether this is done in each `QueueNewTaskAsync` caller or at the general level can be decided by implementer.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2026-01-07T15:49:26Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7zkA","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":588,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Bug] Some unlikely workflow task failures like failure conversion issues may be lost","updatedAt":"2026-01-07T15:49:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/588"}
