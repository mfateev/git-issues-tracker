We have agreed that this is not usually the right approach as it can lead to differences from one SDK or another. So in Go, TypeScript, .NET, Ruby, Python, etc you set your activity options in the workflow at runtime.\n\nWe recommend if you need to have different options (activity options, child options, timer/sleep options, etc) different for different workflow runs, you alter the workflow input to be able to opt-in to the difference (e.g. could have a \"test mode\" if you must). However, we often caution against this because you are no longer testing the same options you will be actually using.","createdAt":"2025-03-07T11:11:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/421#issuecomment-2706180600","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs6hfLHq","author":{"login":"gauravthadani"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"thanks for all the information and sharing the discussion outcomes.
