Please describe.\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\r\n\r\nWe have the following business case:\r\n\r\nDue to compliance and security requirements, our TLS certificates are short lived (a couple of hours). Our Temporal workers live longer than these TLS certificates.\r\n\r\nWe would like the ability to dynamically refresh the TLS options on the Temporal client instead of having to restart the Temporal worker itself if the worker has outlived the original certificate.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, the gRPC connection itself lives in unmanaged rust, so traditional .NET approaches to dynamic certificate refresh such as https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/52779 won't be applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\r\n\r\nPerhaps a variant of the `TlsOptions` class [here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/blob/main/src/Temporalio/Client/TlsOptions.cs), that accepts a callback instead of static values.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class DynamicTlsOptions\r\n{\r\n     public Func<TlsCallbackContext, Task<TlsOptions>> TlsOptionsCallback { get; set; }\r\n\r\n     public TimeSpan MinimumGuaranteedCallbackFrequency { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be preferable for our use case if this callback was asynchronous, but a synchronous callback would work just fine.\r\n\r\nFor our use case, we don't require any metadata or context available to us from Temporal in the callback, provided that there are guarantees about the frequency of how often the callback is invoked (we don't necessarily need this to be a configurable setting).\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n","closedAt":"2025-02-04T18:12:57Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs5pKZ3B","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, this is something we have discussed but it would be more push based than pull based.
