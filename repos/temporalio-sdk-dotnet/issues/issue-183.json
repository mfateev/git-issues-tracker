Please describe.\r\nSupport for Eager Workflow Start (EWS) was added in the server in 1.20, and is currently supported in Java, Python, Core, and Go SDKs. It\r\nreduces the latency to start a workflow by allowing the client to directly schedule the first workflow task to a local worker. See https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/242 for details.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to enable support for EWS in  the .NET SDK using the Core implementation.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nThis mechanism is mostly transparent to the .NET SDK client, but we need to add an optional flag when we start the workflow.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2024-03-01T14:55:25Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-29T19:09:29Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":183,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Eager Workflow Start","updatedAt":"2024-03-01T14:55:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/183"}
