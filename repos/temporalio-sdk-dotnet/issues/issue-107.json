This is `temporal_sdk_bridge.dll` on Windows, `libtemporal_sdk_bridge.so` on Linux, `libtemporal_sdk_bridge.dylib` on macOS, etc and different ones are for different arch's. By default `dotnet build` will copy the artifact to the proper place based on the machine it is building on. But many people may be cross-compiling, so they need to set something like `--runtime linux-x64` when invoking `dotnet build`.\r\n\r\nWe need to make clear this is backed by an unmanaged native shared library, which [RIDs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog) we support, and that they need to be explicitly provided when building for a different platform than where the build runs. Can also just provide some general information about how it works and why we do it (the idea of a high-quality .NET library backed by a Rust core is interesting regardless).","closedAt":"2023-07-18T22:22:59Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-07-14T21:45:05Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":107,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Clarify in README the role of the native shared library","updatedAt":"2023-07-18T22:22:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/107"}
