We should not be using that to determine the first parameter. Rather, we should either use `defn.Delegate.GetType().GetMethod(\"Invoke\")`. Or maybe even better, we should add `object? Invoke(params object?[]? parameters)`, `ReturnType` and `ParameterTypes` to `ActivityDefinition`, and have an alternative constructor like `CreateWithoutAttribute(string name, Type returnType, Type[] parameterTypes, InvokeFunc call)` (where `delegate object? InvokeFunc(params object?[] parms)` exists).","closedAt":"2023-05-16T15:39:50Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs5cYdf8","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is no longer necessary with #67 ","createdAt":"2023-05-16T15:39:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/61#issuecomment-1549916156","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-05-02T22:13:11Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":61,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Activity delegates can sometimes have System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Closure first param","updatedAt":"2023-05-16T15:39:50Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/61"}
