Can probably just make the payload/failure converter properties `Lazy` (`PublicationOnly` because it is expected that multiple instantiations of payload/failure converter can occur).","closedAt":"2023-04-19T19:31:41Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-03-31T12:48:00Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7zkA","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":41,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] DataConverter should not eagerly instantiate payload/failure converter from type","updatedAt":"2023-04-19T19:31:41Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/41"}
