However, there is a concern over a situation with multiple signals in the same task are not run before the primary workflow wakes up.\n\nFor example, given the following code:\n\n```csharp\n[Workflow]\npublic class MyWorkflow\n{\n    private readonly List<string> signals = new();\n\n    [WorkflowRun]\n    public async Task<int> RunAsync()\n    {\n        await Workflow.WaitConditionAsync(() => signals.Count > 0);\n        return signals.Count;\n    }\n\n    [WorkflowSignal]\n    public async Task SignalAsync(string value) => signals.Add(value);\n}\n```\n\nThings that we need to test for:\n\n* If two signals are in the same task, is the workflow result `2`? With where wait conditions are checked this should be true in .NET (though not other languages)\n* If the above is not the case, does handlers-finished check fix it?\n* If an unhandled command is triggered for two signals (e.g. change sample to run local activity instead of waiting condition), will the same assertions hold true?","closedAt":"2025-02-28T14:41:10Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-02-04T15:31:29Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":406,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add tests/confirm signal handlers run first and as expected","updatedAt":"2025-02-28T14:41:10Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/406"}
