There is a fair bit of implementation code involved.  I would like to have the worker register with a shared Temporal.io server and service the task queue for my workflows.  A different server, already providing REST services, would be used to configure schedules and start workflows.  Every example I have seen of the .NET SDK uses a lambda like the following:\n```\nvar handle = await client.StartWorkflowAsync(\n    (MyWorkflow wf) => wf.RunAsync(\"some workflow argument\"),\n    new() { ID = \"my-workflow-id\", TaskQueue = \"my-task-queue\" });\n```\nThe MyWorkFlow typing effectively requires that I pull in the entire dependency tree (out to DI provided services, at least).\n\nIs there a way to simply do something like the following?\n```\nvar handle = await client.StartWorkflowAsync(\"myworkflowname\", args, new() { ID = ... });\n```\n\nThe CLI lets you do this (as with the following).  Is there a way to access the CLI processor via gRPC or REST?\n\n```\ntemporal workflow start \\\n    --workflow-id YourWorkflowId \\\n    --type YourWorkflow \\\n    --task-queue YourTaskQueue \\\n    --input '{\"some-key\": \"some-value\"}'\n```\n\nThank you in advance!","closedAt":"2025-08-05T12:40:35Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs68Dkoy","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> Is there a way to simply do something like the following?\n\nAbsolutely. See the overloads for `StartWorkflowAsync`. One accepts a string workflow type name and an object collection of arguments. The lambda-expression-based ones are just type-safe sugar for the string based ones.\n\nClosing, but feel free to continue commenting.
