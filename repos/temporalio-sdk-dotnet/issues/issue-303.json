We might as well add `Workflow.WhenAllAsync`, `Workflow.StartNewTask`, and any other common/popular standard library task functions, even though they are safe and will just be one-liners to the underlying implementations. This lets users have confidence in calls on the `Workflow` class.","closedAt":"2024-08-06T22:15:24Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-07-10T19:03:08Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":303,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Create wrappers for commonly-known-safe async calls","updatedAt":"2024-08-06T22:15:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/303"}
