This should be extended to the remaining classes that currently maintain the lifetime of unmanaged pointers.\n- Pointer lifetime management should be exclusively maintained by `SafeHandle` types for each unmanaged pointer type.\n- Consumers of the unmanaged pointers should use the `Scope.Pointer` method to add-ref on a `SafeHandle`, which will return the unmanaged pointer value.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2026-01-06T17:13:15Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":586,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Separate unmanaged pointer lifecycle management into SafeHandles","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T17:13:15Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/586"}
