However, this is trickier than it seems. If you `await` it _may_ use the current task scheduler. We have found a way to do this by creating a task on the default scheduler and explicitly `Wait`ing on it, but it's even harder to get back on the workflow scheduler if you want that.\r\n\r\nI am closing this since the solution presented (disabling this inside a workflow) does not solve the actual problem of running outside the workflow scheduler.
