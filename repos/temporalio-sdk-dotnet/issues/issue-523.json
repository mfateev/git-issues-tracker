But to match Java, we actually need to only selectively apply contexts based on their situation. This applies to payload converter, failure converter, and payload codec. We will have to decide whether we want the context present on the payload/failure converter we expose to users.\n\nThis is technically a backwards incompatible change as we had not explicitly marked the .NET serialization context addition as experimental, so the implementer will have to decide how best to handle that.","closedAt":"2025-09-25T18:37:08Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-22T15:25:04Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7zkA","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":523,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Serialization context incorrectly applied to all workflow calls","updatedAt":"2025-09-25T18:37:08Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/523"}
