Make a separate constructor that accepts a workflow type and a nullable run ID and expose workflow type property and make the run ID nullable. That last part shouldn't be a serious breaking change, though it is technically breaking.","closedAt":"2024-12-11T17:58:44Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-11-22T21:45:06Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7zkA","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":371,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Child workflow already started puts workflow type where run ID is","updatedAt":"2024-12-11T17:58:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/371"}
