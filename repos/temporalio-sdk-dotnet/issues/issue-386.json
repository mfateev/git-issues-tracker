This doesn't allow you to guarantee the condition is true on the line after the wait condition. We should only wake up a _single_ wait condition when satisfied and then run the entire loop again. This will allow you to implement things like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nawait Workflow.WaitConditionAsync(() => !locked);\r\nlocked = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this issue is similar to https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/618 in Python.
