Please describe.\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\nThe .NET SDK currently does not support the `linux-musl-arm64` runtime identifier (RID). This limitation has become more significant with the release of .NET 10, as Microsoft has removed Debian images from their official container registry, leaving only the following supported base images:\n- Azure Linux\n- Ubuntu\n- Alpine\n\nThis change makes Alpine-based containers (which use musl libc) a more common choice, particularly for ARM64 deployments, but the lack of `linux-musl-arm64` support prevents users from running the Temporal .NET SDK in these environments.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\nAdd support for the `linux-musl-arm64` runtime identifier to the built-in native shared libraries, alongside the currently supported RIDs listed in the [SDK documentation](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet?tab=readme-ov-file#built-in-native-shared-library).\n\nThis would enable developers to:\n- Deploy the .NET SDK on Alpine-based ARM64 containers\n- Maintain compatibility with modern .NET container practices\n- Support a wider range of deployment scenarios\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\nMicrosoft's decision to discontinue Debian images in .NET 10: [dotnet/dotnet-docker#6734](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/6734)","closedAt":"2026-01-21T16:10:03Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs7gMIyX","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"After discussion with team, even though this will expand our NuGet package, this is something that makes sense for us to implement (and add a smoke test at package build time to confirm).
