We could use `IOptionsMonitor`, but the `IOptionsMonitor` we use is named with an internal unique name we'd have to expose and it only has connection options, not the client itself and we want to force users to create the client itself. A better pattern would be a `ClientUpdater` which the user can instantiate (or use from DI) and set on the worker service options. They can then use that to push a client down to all workers (so internally workers would subscribe to client update events on the updater). Make sure to test and document manual instantiation _and_ DI-based instantiation of this updater.","closedAt":"2024-06-07T13:36:37Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOInL6Hs6AcIEs","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is now supported in 1.1.2 with #258.","createdAt":"2024-06-07T13:36:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/257#issuecomment-2154856748","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-05-31T12:30:14Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOInL6Hs8AAAABJH7znQ","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":257,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Support worker client update when using generic host","updatedAt":"2024-06-07T13:36:37Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/257"}
