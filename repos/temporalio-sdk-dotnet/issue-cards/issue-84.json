  "userImpact": "Users may experience workflows that fail to resume after application restarts when child workflows are in progress, unless properly configured with timeouts and heartbeats.",
  "rootCause": "Missing activity heartbeating and improper timeout configuration (using ScheduleToCloseTimeout instead of StartToCloseTimeout) caused the server to think activities were still running, preventing workflow resumption.",
  "proposedFix": "Set StartToCloseTimeout to a reasonable value based on expected activity duration and implement regular activity heartbeating to keep the server informed of activity progress.",
  "workaround": "Configure StartToCloseTimeout appropriately and ensure activities implement heartbeating as documented in the SDK.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "User resolved the issue by switching from ScheduleToCloseTimeout to StartToCloseTimeout with a 1-second timeout and implementing proper activity heartbeating.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "you have crashed an activity without the server knowing. For all but the most immediate activities, you should set a HeartbeatTimeout and heartbeat regularly",
