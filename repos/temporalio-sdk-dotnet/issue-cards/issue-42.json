  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot deploy .NET Temporal SDK applications to Linux Docker environments or Azure Functions, as the required native library fails to load.",
  "rootCause": "The native temporal_sdk_bridge library is not included in the deployment output alongside the managed assemblies, likely due to build/packaging configuration issues.",
  "proposedFix": "Ensure temporal_sdk_bridge.dll and other native dependencies are included in the bin directory during dotnet build and deployment processes.",
  "workaround": "Manually copy the temporal_sdk_bridge.dll and related native DLLs to the deployment directory alongside managed assemblies.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Marked as invalid - issue was due to incomplete deployment/packaging. The SDK properly includes native dependencies in nuget package, but users must ensure they're present in their deployment.",
