  "summary": "Implement OpenTelemetry support for distributed tracing in the .NET SDK via an interceptor-based approach. The feature requires careful handling of span context propagation across service boundaries and resolution of activity context restoration challenges in .NET's distributed tracing model.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users can integrate OpenTelemetry tracing to monitor and visualize Temporal workflow execution across distributed systems.",
  "rootCause": ".NET's distributed tracing model only supports setting current Activity, not restoring arbitrary ActivityContext as current context like other OTel SDKs, requiring activity recreation rather than simple context attachment.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a Temporalio.Extensions.Tracing project (instead of OTel-specific) using interceptor pattern similar to Python SDK; leverage DistributedContextPropagator for span serialization to Temporal headers.",
  "workaround": "For metrics, users can create custom TemporalRuntime with metrics telemetry options pointed to OTel gRPC URL; for tracing, must recreate Activity and copy fields, setting as Activity.Current.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "OpenTelemetry tracing support was implemented in the .NET SDK via interceptor-based approach in a separate extensions project.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "So it will be interceptor powered (like Python's), but I am struggling with how best to split the project up.",
