  "userImpact": "Users with synchronous activity helper methods cannot easily unit test them without workarounds like creating mock interfaces or converting methods to async.",
  "rootCause": "ActivityEnvironment only provides an async API (RunAsync) to support potential future asynchronous internal operations and consistency with TemporalWorker's async-only design.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a synchronous Run method to ActivityEnvironment that wraps the async RunAsync method for testing synchronous code.",
