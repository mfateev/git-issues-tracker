  "userImpact": "Users with legacy 32-bit systems cannot directly use Temporal activities with their existing 32-bit SDKs and must use wrapper APIs instead.",
  "rootCause": "NuGet package size constraints (50MB compressed) and lack of 32-bit testing infrastructure make adding win-x86 support impractical currently.",
  "proposedFix": "Possible future separate NuGet package dedicated to 32-bit support, or user can build and package SDK independently for 32-bit targets.",
  "workaround": "Wrap the 32-bit library in an API that the activity calls out to, or build the SDK on 32-bit and create a custom package.",
