  "summary": "The non-generic ExecuteAsync(Func<Task>) overload loses exceptions thrown by user tasks and throws TaskCanceledException instead. This regression affects workflows returning Task (void) but not Task<T>, caused by using OnlyOnRanToCompletion continuation option that discards exceptions.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly handle exceptions from void workflows because the original exception is replaced with TaskCanceledException, breaking error handling and debugging.",
  "rootCause": "ExecuteAsync(Func<Task>) uses ContinueWith with OnlyOnRanToCompletion, which prevents continuation execution when the task throws, causing the exception to be discarded and the resulting task to be canceled instead of faulted.",

  "keyQuote": "When untilComplete() throws, OnlyOnRanToCompletion prevents the continuation from running, and the resulting task is canceled (not faulted). The original exception is discarded.",
