  "summary": "Two vulnerabilities detected in tokio 1.23.0 dependency: a high-severity soundness issue in ReadHalf::unsplit that can violate Pin contracts (CVSS 9.8), and a medium-severity Windows named pipe security issue where pipe_mode resets reject_remote_clients to false (CVSS 5.4).",

  "userImpact": "Applications using the .NET SDK with tokio 1.23.0 are exposed to critical security vulnerabilities that could lead to use-after-free exploits and unauthorized remote access to named pipes.",
  "rootCause": "Tokio 1.23.0 contains two unpatched CVEs: WS-2023-0027 (Pin contract violation in ReadHalf::unsplit) and CVE-2023-22466 (pipe_mode resetting reject_remote_clients on Windows).",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade tokio to version 1.24.2 (fixes both vulnerabilities) or minimum safe versions: 1.18.5, 1.20.4, or 1.23.1.",
  "workaround": "For CVE-2023-22466 on Windows: ensure pipe_mode is set first after initializing ServerOptions before setting reject_remote_clients.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was automatically closed by Mend because the vulnerable library was either marked as ignored or is no longer part of the Mend inventory, indicating the dependency has been updated or removed.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The tokio feature io-util is also required to be enabled to trigger this soundness issue. Remote clients may only access the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a publicly shared folder (SMB).",
