  "rootCause": "ActivityInboundInterceptor lacks access to the scoped IServiceProvider instance during ExecuteActivityAsync invocation, and the Temporalio.Worker.Interceptors namespace is intentionally agnostic of Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a mechanism similar to ASP.NET's HttpContextAccessor to provide access to the scoped IServiceProvider within the interceptor context, keeping the knowledge about IServiceProvider separate from the agnostic interceptor components.",
