  "userImpact": "Users experience timeout errors when starting workflows after 1-2 days, and the connection doesn't automatically recover even with configured retry logic, requiring manual application restart.",
  "rootCause": "Likely idle connection timeout from Azure cloud environment closing outbound connections; keep-alive mechanism not preventing disconnection in this scenario",
  "proposedFix": "Update to SDK version with improved keep-alive mechanism; monitor for connection state and implement automatic reconnection",
  "workaround": "Configure exponential retry logic on workflow start calls; manually restart application when timeouts occur",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was resolved by updating to beta2 with improved keep-alive mechanism. Azure environment idle timeouts were identified as root cause; keep-alive enabled by default in newer versions prevents this.",
