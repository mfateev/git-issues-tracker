  "summary": "The README needs to clarify that the .NET SDK requires a native shared library (temporal_sdk_bridge) for different platforms and architectures. Users building for different platforms than their build machine need explicit runtime identifiers, and the documentation should explain why a Rust-backed native library is used.",

  "userImpact": "Users attempting to build for different platforms are confused about native library requirements and may experience build failures without explicit RID configuration.",
  "rootCause": "The README does not adequately document the dependency on platform-specific native shared libraries or the need for explicit runtime identifiers during cross-platform builds.",
  "proposedFix": "Update the README to clarify the native shared library dependency, list supported RIDs, explain the need for explicit --runtime flags when cross-compiling, and provide context about why the library uses a Rust-backed native core.",

  "keyQuote": "We need to make clear this is backed by an unmanaged native shared library, which RIDs we support, and that they need to be explicitly provided when building for a different platform",
