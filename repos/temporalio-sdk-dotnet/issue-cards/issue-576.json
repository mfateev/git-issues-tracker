  "summary": "Request for a Roslyn analyzer tool for .NET to detect workflow constraint violations at compile-time, similar to existing analyzers in Go and Java SDKs. The analyzer should transitively check for invalid actions within workflows, display call graph stacks for violations, and integrate with the Temporalio NuGet package.",
