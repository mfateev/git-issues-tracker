  "summary": "Feature request to add support for Windows ARM64 (win-arm64) architecture in the .NET SDK. Users are increasingly using Windows on ARM devices, and the library should provide native support similar to Linux and macOS distributions.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Windows ARM64 users currently cannot use the SDK natively and must manually install prebuilt DLLs from external sources or compile the bridge themselves.",
  "rootCause": "The win-arm64 native bridge DLL is not included in the NuGet package distribution, requiring manual workarounds for ARM64 users.",
  "proposedFix": "Include the win-arm64 native bridge DLL in the NuGet package by default. Alternatively, offer it as a separate NuGet package. Utilize GitHub Windows ARM runners for CI/CD integration.",
  "workaround": "Users can manually download the prebuilt win-arm64 bridge DLL from OneDrive and place it in the NuGet package cache at runtimes/win-arm64/native/ directory.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Support was added in version 1.7.0 and later releases (1.8.0, 1.9.0) with the win-arm64 native bridge DLL included in the package. GitHub Windows ARM runners became available for CI integration.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Almost every other development tool works natively on ARM out of the box. Why the hesitation to include it by default when Linux and OSX both get it?",
