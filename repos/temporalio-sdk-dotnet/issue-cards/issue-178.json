  "userImpact": "Users receive inconsistent exception types when cancelling child workflows depending on timing, making error handling and cancellation detection unreliable.",
  "rootCause": "Code that attempts to handle pre-scheduled cancellations may not execute before the call is handed off to Core, resulting in improper exception type being returned.",
  "proposedFix": "Document that calling with an already-cancelled token may have different exceptions than if cancelled before/after start, and recommend using TemporalException.IsCanceledException helper for cancellation detection.",
  "workaround": "Use TemporalException.IsCanceledException helper method to reliably detect cancelled exceptions regardless of type.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved as documentation issue. The behavior is consistent with .NET patterns (eager cancellation exceptions), so users should use the IsCanceledException helper for reliable cancellation detection.",
