  "userImpact": "Users cannot use the .NET SDK with Blazor WebAssembly applications due to unsupported System.Diagnostics.Process API calls.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK uses System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id which relies on P/Invoke and is incompatible with WebAssembly execution environment.",

  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The maintainer determined that the SDK uses a Rust-based core via P/Invoke which is fundamentally incompatible with WASM. The issue was closed as not applicable because the entire SDK cannot support Blazor/WASM at this time.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "We use a Rust-based core for this library via P/Invoke and therefore it won't be Blazor/WASM compatible anyways.",
