  "userImpact": "Users cannot safely run non-workflow async calls within workflow interceptors without workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "Running arbitrary async calls in workflow interceptors may use the current task scheduler instead of the workflow scheduler, making the proposed tracing disable feature insufficient to solve the actual problem.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a mechanism to disable tracing events (initially proposed as a using statement), though this was found to be inadequate for the actual use case.",
  "workaround": "Create a task on the default scheduler and explicitly Wait on it, then explicitly manage switching back to the workflow scheduler if needed.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The proposed solution of disabling tracing events does not solve the actual problem of safely running outside the workflow scheduler. The underlying issue requires a different architectural approach.",
