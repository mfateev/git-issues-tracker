  "userImpact": "Users need assurance that signal handlers execute in the correct order and that multiple signals in a single task are fully processed before the workflow's main logic resumes.",
  "rootCause": "Uncertainty about whether multiple signals in the same task execute before workflow wake-up and whether the handlers-finished check is needed to guarantee this behavior.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement comprehensive tests covering: (1) two signals in same task result in expected count, (2) handlers-finished check effectiveness, (3) same assertions hold with unhandled commands like local activities.",

  "keyQuote": "If two signals are in the same task, is the workflow result `2`? With where wait conditions are checked this should be true in .NET",
