  "summary": "WaitConditionAsync currently wakes up all satisfied conditions simultaneously, making it impossible to guarantee a condition remains true after the wait. The request is to wake only a single condition at a time and re-evaluate the loop, enabling safe patterns like acquiring locks within wait conditions.",
