  "summary": "Go SDK child workflows that return no value (nil/missing result) cause .NET parent workflows to hang indefinitely when awaiting completion. The issue stems from Go SDK omitting the result field entirely when a child workflow has no return value, which .NET SDK doesn't handle properly.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably call Go child workflows from .NET parent workflows if the child returns no value, causing parent workflows to hang indefinitely.",
  "rootCause": "Go SDK omits the result field in ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted events when a workflow returns nil, but .NET SDK expects this field to be present and fails to complete the async task when it's missing.",
  "proposedFix": "Go SDK should include an empty or null result payload in ChildWorkflowExecutionCompleted events even when the workflow returns no value, ensuring compatibility with other SDKs.",
  "workaround": "Child workflows in Go should return a non-null value (e.g., struct{}{}) when called from .NET parent workflows.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Go SDK was fixed to properly include result payloads in completion events to ensure cross-SDK compatibility.",
