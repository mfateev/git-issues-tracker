  "userImpact": "Users have less control over heartbeat behavior and experience inconsistent activity timeout handling compared to other SDKs due to the long default throttling interval.",
  "rootCause": "The heartbeat throttling interval is hardcoded to 10 minutes in the Go SDK implementation, differing from behavior specified in the cross-SDK specification.",
  "proposedFix": "Make the heartbeat throttling interval configurable through ActivityOptions and reduce the default interval below 10 minutes to match other SDK implementations.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The interval was made configurable and the default was reduced to align with other SDKs.",
