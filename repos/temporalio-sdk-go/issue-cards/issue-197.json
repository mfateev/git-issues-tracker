  "userImpact": "Users with workflows having identical function names in different packages will have the wrong workflow invoked during ContinueAsNew operations, causing runtime confusion and incorrect workflow execution.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK uses only the simple function name as the workflow identifier/alias without considering package context, allowing two different functions with the same name to overwrite each other's registration.",
  "proposedFix": "The SDK should panic if a workflow name is reused during registration unless DisableAlreadyRegisteredCheck is explicitly set to true in the options.",
  "workaround": "Reference the custom workflow name (registered via options) instead of the function pointer when calling ContinueAsNew.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by clarifying that function name is used as the default workflow name and can be overridden via options. Related issue #672 opened to allow disabling function name as an alias.",
