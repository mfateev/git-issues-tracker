Multiple transitive dependencies (envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate, cncf/udpa) register the same gogo.proto extensions, causing initialization failure in Go applications.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Applications using the SDK fail to start with a panic error when protobuf dependencies are improperly configured or when transitive dependencies have conflicting extension registrations.",
  "rootCause": "Multiple transitive dependencies (protoc-gen-validate, udpa) included in the dependency tree register the same protobuf extensions (e.g., descriptor.EnumOptions 62001) to gogo.proto, causing duplicate registration panics during module initialization.",
  "proposedFix": "Update dependency versions or refactor dependency tree to avoid multiple registrations of the same protobuf extensions. Using latest master commit resolved the issue.",
  "workaround": "Remove vendor directory and use Go modules with 'go mod download' instead of vendoring; ensure go.mod/go.sum properly resolve dependencies without duplication.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by updating to a later version of dependencies (confirmed working on latest master commit). The issue was related to how protobuf extensions were registered across multiple transitive dependencies.",
