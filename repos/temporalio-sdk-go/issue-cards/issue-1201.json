  "userImpact": "Users cannot access partial results when an activity fails, making it difficult to handle errors that still produce useful data.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal architecture design choice to support multiple languages and maintain backward compatibility by treating result and error as mutually exclusive.",
  "proposedFix": "Add result field to RespondActivityTaskFailedRequest matching RespondActivityTaskCompletedRequest.Result structure, or alternatively use NewApplicationError with details.",
  "workaround": "Use NewApplicationError with details parameter to return error information along with data.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer explained that the current architecture (result XOR error) is intentional for cross-language support and backward compatibility. Users should use NewApplicationError with details instead.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "In Temporal a workflow or an activity can either return a result or an error... Returning an error and a value that are both valid is a special case.",
