  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably create clients when the health check service has intermittent failures, forcing them to disable health checks or implement custom retry logic.",
  "rootCause": "The checkHealth function has no retry mechanism and is called synchronously during client creation, causing immediate failure on any health check error.",
  "proposedFix": "Add more sophisticated retry logic to health check calls during client creation, or provide configuration options in ConnectionOptions to control retry behavior.",
  "workaround": "Disable health check via DisableHealthCheck option or implement retries in application layer.",
