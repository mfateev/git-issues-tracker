  "summary": "Users of the Workflow linter need a way to override the entry point for checking, as generic helper functions wrapping the actual workflow logic cause the checker to analyze the wrapper instead of the deterministic workflow code.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot use generic helper functions to wrap workflows without the linter false-alarming on non-deterministic code in the wrapper.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow checker cannot trace through generic function wrappers to identify the actual workflow entry point that needs determinism checking.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow configuring an alternate entry point method for the linter to check (e.g., (w *Workflow) Execute instead of (w *Workflow) Run).",
  "workaround": "Recent changes in #1215 now check all functions accepting workflow.Context as first parameter, which resolved the issue.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "PR #1215 implemented checking all functions with workflow.Context as first parameter, allowing the checker to find the actual workflow logic.",

  "keyQuote": "since we're using generics the workflow checker doesn't know that the main body of the workflow is actually the w.Execute function",
