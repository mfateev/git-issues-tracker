  "userImpact": "Developers cannot reliably test signal exchanges between parent and child workflows in test environments, limiting test coverage for signal-based workflows.",

  "keyQuote": "This is expected behaviour, if you parent workflow finished by default your child workflow is terminated and will no longer receive signals.",
