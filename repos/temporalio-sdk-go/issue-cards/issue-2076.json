The request is to add naming capabilities to SideEffects for better timeline visibility, though the maintainer proposed using marker summaries instead.",

  "userImpact": "Users with many sequential SideEffects struggle to identify which side effect performed which operation when reviewing workflow timelines.",
  "rootCause": "SideEffect markers lack identifying information (names or summaries) in the timeline, forcing users to decode functionality from serialized payloads.",
  "proposedFix": "Add SideEffectOptions with Name parameter to allow custom marker names, or alternatively add Summaries to markers for UI display similar to Activities/LocalActivities.",
  "workaround": "Manually inspect SideEffect payloads to determine which method was called; alternative approach using MutableSideEffect IDs but IDs are not shown in timeline.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
