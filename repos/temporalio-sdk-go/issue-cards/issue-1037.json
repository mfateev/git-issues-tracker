  "userImpact": "Users encounter runtime panics when passing pointer types to activities that have value receiver methods, limiting how they can structure activity definitions.",
  "rootCause": "Go's method spec automatically dereferences pointers when accessing value receiver methods (pt.Mv ≡ (*pt).Mv), but the Temporal SDK's reflection-based activity invocation doesn't account for this, resulting in nil pointer dereference when the pointer is nil or uninitialized.",
  "proposedFix": "Support uncurried method syntax (e.g., ActivityStruct.Activity instead of a.Activity) to avoid automatic dereferencing, or add validation checks in the workflow type checker to detect and warn about incompatible method-pointer combinations.",
  "workaround": "Use pointer receiver methods with initialized pointers, or use top-level functions instead of methods for activities.",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "There is an alternative in that we may be able to support `ActivityStruct.Activity` but that basically uncurries the first arg as the receiver which has other implications.",
