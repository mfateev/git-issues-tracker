  "userImpact": "Users cannot run workflowcheck through golangci-lint or standalone with certain codebases because the tool crashes on packages without source files.",
  "rootCause": "The code assumes pass.Files slice is non-empty when it can be empty for certain packages (like 'unsafe'). The golang/tools analysis framework still has this assumption in its debug logging code at checker.go:591.",
