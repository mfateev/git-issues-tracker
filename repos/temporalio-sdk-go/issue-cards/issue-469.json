  "summary": "Feature request to propagate context cancellations to workflow futures via a new `WorkflowCancelingGet` method that cancels the underlying workflow instead of just unblocking the Get call. This would allow conventional context-aware cancellation patterns common in Go web applications.",

  "proposedFix": "Add a new `WorkflowCancelingGet(ctx, valuePtr)` method that cancels the workflow when the context is cancelled, in addition to the existing `Get` behavior.",

  "resolutionDetails": "The maintainers indicated no plans to change how WorkflowRun.Get(ctx, valuePtr) works and suggested using WorkflowClient.CancelWorkflow() as the standard approach.",
