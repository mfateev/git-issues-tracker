  "userImpact": "Users cannot register namespaces or create workflows when library versions are mismatched or the frontend service is unreachable, blocking basic workflow setup.",
  "rootCause": "Version mismatch between go.temporal.io/temporal and go.temporal.io/temporal-proto libraries, or inability to connect to the Temporal frontend service due to incorrect host/port configuration.",
  "proposedFix": "Ensure all Go SDK libraries (temporal, temporal-proto) match versions. Verify that the client can connect to the Temporal frontend service at the configured host and port.",
  "workaround": "Downgrade Go SDK libraries to match the Temporal server version (e.g., use 0.23.1 when server is 0.23.1), or use matching docker image tags.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue resolved through version alignment - users confirmed that matching Go SDK versions with server versions or using consistent docker image tags resolved the problem.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "If you downgrade your go libraries to match the docker images (0.23.1) it worked as expected for me.",
