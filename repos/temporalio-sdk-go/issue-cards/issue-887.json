  "summary": "Workflow and activity methods with identical names collide in the test framework's mock system, causing incorrect mock signature validation errors despite the workflow executing correctly in production. The test framework doesn't incorporate type information when creating mock names, leading to ambiguity between methods with the same name in different contexts.",
