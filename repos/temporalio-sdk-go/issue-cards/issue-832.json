  "userImpact": "Users upgrading to the latest temporal SDK cannot build their applications due to interface incompatibility with the latest API version.",
  "rootCause": "API v1.9.0 added GetWorkerBuildIdOrdering method to WorkflowServiceServer interface, but SDK v1.15.0's workflowServiceProxyServer implementation did not include this method.",
  "proposedFix": "Embed UnimplementedWorkflowServiceServer in the service proxy to automatically provide implementations for new API methods, preventing older SDKs from breaking with newer API versions.",
  "workaround": "Users can either downgrade the API dependency (go get go.temporal.io/api@v1.8.0) or use the master branch of the SDK (not recommended).",
  "resolution": "fixed",

  "keyQuote": "I think what I am going to do here is at least embed `UnimplementedWorkflowServiceServer` so that new APIs don't break older SDKs.",
