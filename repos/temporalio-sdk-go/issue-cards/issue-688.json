  "userImpact": "Users cannot use receiver-less method references in OnActivity mocks and must use instance method references instead.",
  "rootCause": "Go's reflection system cannot reliably determine at runtime whether a function pointer represents a receiver-less method reference versus a regular function, making it impossible to automatically adjust parameter handling.",
  "proposedFix": "Clarify in documentation the correct syntax for registering activities and mocking them with method references.",
  "workaround": "Use instance method references like `OnActivity(new(myStruct).MyFunc)` instead of receiver-less references like `OnActivity((*myStruct).MyFunc)`.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Investigation confirmed the limitation cannot be resolved at runtime, so documentation was updated to clarify the behavior.",

  "keyQuote": "After investigation, I have confirmed we cannot really do anything here at runtime because we also don't support registration of activities this way",
