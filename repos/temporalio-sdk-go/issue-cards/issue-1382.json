  "userImpact": "Users trying to use workflowcheck with Go 1.22 experience runtime panics and cannot run the tool without manual workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "Go 1.22 introduced changes to the go/types API that require a newer version of golang.org/x/tools (v0.13.0+). workflowcheck v0.1.0 depended on v0.10.0 which is incompatible with these changes.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade golang.org/x/tools dependency to v0.13.0 or newer and release a new version of workflowcheck.",
  "workaround": "Users can add workflowcheck to their go.mod/tools.go with x/tools v0.13.0+ and run without the @latest suffix to use the newer x/tools version from their own go.mod.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fix was merged to HEAD, and workflowcheck v0.2.0 was released with the upgraded x/tools dependency after Go SDK v1.26.0 release.",
