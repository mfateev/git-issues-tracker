  "rootCause": "NewClient unexpectedly performs server connectivity validation during construction, limiting flexibility for users who prefer lazy connection establishment.",
  "proposedFix": "Add DisableEagerConnection option to ConnectionOptions, introduce Dial and NewLazyClient constructors, implement lazy ensureServerCapabilitiesFetched, and add CheckHealth using gRPC health API.",
