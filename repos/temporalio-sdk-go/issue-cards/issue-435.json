  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot scale workflow execution with higher concurrency limits without triggering deadlock detection panics, limiting throughput and requiring manual tuning of worker configuration.",
  "rootCause": "Deadlock detector uses a fixed 1-second timeout to detect when goroutines cannot be scheduled; under high load with many concurrent tasks, legitimate goroutines may exceed this threshold, triggering false-positive panics.",
  "proposedFix": "Make the deadlock detection timeout value configurable via a worker option instead of relying only on the TEMPORAL_DEBUG environment variable.",
  "workaround": "Set the TEMPORAL_DEBUG environment variable to disable deadlock detection entirely, or reduce MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize and MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize values.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The team acknowledged the request and decided to make the 1-second timeout configurable as a future enhancement.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Deadlock detector fires when a goroutine cannot get scheduled for execution for one second. It means that that your process is significantly overloaded.",
