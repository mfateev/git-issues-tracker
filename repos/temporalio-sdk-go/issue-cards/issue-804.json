  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily extract trace IDs from workflow context for structured logging, limiting observability in distributed tracing scenarios.",
  "rootCause": "Span context is stored in a non-exported struct key in the workflow context, making it inaccessible to users without SDK modifications.",
  "proposedFix": "Set a custom value via TracerOptions.SpanContextKey to access span information, or pass custom info through context and workflow.GetInfo().",
  "workaround": "Use TracerOptions.SpanContextKey with a custom value to extract span context, or implement custom context propagation instead of relying on span info.",

  "keyQuote": "You may set `TracerOptions.SpanContextKey` to a custom value of your choice and then use that value to extract the span out of the context.",
