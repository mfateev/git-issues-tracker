  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users have difficulty diagnosing workflow deadlocks because they cannot see the stack traces of blocked coroutines, making troubleshooting complex concurrency issues harder.",
  "rootCause": "Go does not provide direct APIs to identify or introspect specific goroutines by ID, requiring workarounds like stack parsing or internal reflection.",
  "proposedFix": "Track goroutine IDs when workflow.Go is called, then parse runtime.Stack() output to filter and display only the stack traces of running coroutines for the workflow. Can be made opt-in if performance is a concern.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented stack trace collection for deadlocked coroutines. Discussion clarified that only one coroutine can be executing at timeout, simplifying the implementation approach.",
