  "summary": "Add support for replaying multiple workflow histories in a loop in the Go SDK, similar to existing functionality in TypeScript and Python SDKs. The team decided this wasn't necessary as a built-in feature since calling ReplayWorkflowHistory in a loop is already performant, but a list API for histories should be added to match other SDKs.",
