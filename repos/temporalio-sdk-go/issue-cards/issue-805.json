  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily unit test workflows that rely on `ContinueAsNewError` for multi-run behavior without setting up full integration tests.",
  "rootCause": "The test suite represents a single workflow run and does not support simulating multi-run scenarios triggered by `ContinueAsNewError`.",
  "proposedFix": "Add an `EnableRunContinueAsNew` method to `TestWorkflowEnvironment` to execute the workflow instead of returning the error.",
  "workaround": "Use integration testing with a full Temporal server setup or mock child workflows with `env.OnWorkflow`.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer clarified that unit tests should test single runs, not multi-run scenarios. Multi-run testing is better suited for integration tests with `temporalite/temporaltest`.",

  "keyQuote": "The workflow unit test represents a single run, not multiple (be it by retry, continue as new, cron, etc).",
