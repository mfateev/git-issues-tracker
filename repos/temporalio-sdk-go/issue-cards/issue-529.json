  "summary": "The Go SDK's interceptor design lacks capabilities present in Java and Node.js SDKs. Interceptors cannot modify default SDK behavior, don't capture full operation spans for tracing, and some methods aren't properly chainable, limiting use cases like authorization and distributed tracing.",
