  "summary": "Defers in workflow.Go are currently running in parallel during cache eviction, but should run deterministically and in sequence. While PR #1210 fixed the main consequence, edge cases remain where parallel execution could cause user issues, and we need to ensure cache eviction doesn't get blocked by this fix.",
