  "rootCause": "SDK currently relies on every API message through proxy and interceptor code generation, creating unnecessary coupling.",
  "proposedFix": "Create cmd/generateproxy binary in api-go that generates proxy and interceptor code, with separate go.mod to avoid forcing dependencies. Tool should generate go.temporal.io/api/proxy package with WorkflowServiceProxyServer and PayloadVisitorInterceptor.",
