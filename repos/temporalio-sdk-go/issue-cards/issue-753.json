  "userImpact": "Services cannot tolerate blocking on Temporal server connection during startup, causing service failures during deploy/scale events when multiple dependencies exist.",
  "rootCause": "The mandatory getCapabilities call during client creation in v1.14.0 forces eager connection, removing the ability to defer connection until first use.",
  "proposedFix": "Each call on the client should check connection status and use a mutex to create connection lazily before allowing operations to proceed.",
  "workaround": "Duplicate the entire client interface in the application to wrap calls with lazy connection logic, or implement a separate factory pattern with explicit GetConnection() call.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Internal discussion concluded that moving to lazy connection model was the right approach across languages.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Fail fast in a critical application with multiple concerns is a non-starter. It can block and bring an entire service down during a deploy, scale up, or other lifecycle event",
