  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily retrieve workflow input through the WorkflowRun interface and must manually parse history events as a workaround.",
  "rootCause": "The WorkflowRun interface lacks a method to access input parameters; this information is available in the history but not exposed through the public API.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a method to WorkflowRun interface to get input, with server-side support tracked in temporalio/temporal#8608 and planned for the Describe RPC.",
  "workaround": "Fetch the workflow history and examine the first event to extract the input parameters.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by adding input retrieval capability through the Describe RPC on the server side (temporalio/temporal#8608), making it available on the WorkflowRun interface.",
  "related": [
    8608
  ],
  "keyQuote": "When the server issue is resolved it will be available on `Describe`. For now the only solution is to look at history.",
