  "userImpact": "Users encountering non-deterministic panics need a better way to automatically reset workflows without the limitations of retry policies or risk of infinite loops.",
  "rootCause": "Non-deterministic exceptions in workflow execution lack a clean reset mechanism; existing alternatives (FailWorkflow + RetryPolicy or manual error wrapping) have significant limitations.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a new `ResetWorkflow` panic policy option that automatically resets the workflow from the start on panic, with a maximum limit to prevent infinite loops.",
  "workaround": "Use `WorkflowPanicPolicy` set to `FailWorkflow` combined with `RetryPolicy` when starting the workflow, though this doesn't replay signals and requires wrapping errors with `temporal.NewNonRetryableError`.",
