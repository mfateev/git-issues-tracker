  "userImpact": "Oversized workflow task completions cause implicit retries instead of failing workflow tasks, leading to delayed failure visibility and potential retry storms.",
  "rootCause": "The gRPC interceptor treats all ResourceExhausted errors uniformly and retries them, but grpc-message-size-too-large errors are unrecoverable and should not be retried.",
