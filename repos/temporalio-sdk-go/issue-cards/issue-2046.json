  "userImpact": "Users with long-running JSON processing in workflows face destructive failures and customer-facing outages due to strict deadlock detection with no visibility or configuration options.",
  "rootCause": "Large JSON payloads processed in workflow code trigger deadlock detection timeout (>1 second without yield), but this is not always an actual deadlock and lacks configurability for different use cases.",
  "proposedFix": "Make the deadlock converter configurable by: 1) adding a callback for warnings to emit metrics, 2) making warning and error thresholds adjustable",
  "workaround": "Use DataConverterWithoutDeadlockDetection to disable the deadlock detector, or move long-running operations to activities/local activities",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer clarified that long-running operations cannot be done in workflow code due to strict workflow task timeouts, and recommended using activities or DataConverterWithoutDeadlockDetection as existing solutions",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Long running actions cannot be done in workflow code, workflow tasks have a strict timeout so long running actions need to be done in either and activity or local activity",
