  "userImpact": "Developers can now use a single, intuitive UpdateWithStartWorkflow API instead of calling ExecuteWorkflow twice with specific options.",
  "rootCause": "The original API design required understanding WorkflowIDConflictPolicy and multiple ExecuteWorkflow calls to accomplish a single logical operation.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide a single dedicated function (client.UpdateWithStartWorkflow) that hides the implementation details of update-with-start operations.",
  "workaround": "Call ExecuteWorkflow twice: once with USE_EXISTING conflict policy, then with WithStartOperation set to NewUpdateWithStartWorkflowOperation.",
