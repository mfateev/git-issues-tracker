  "userImpact": "Workers cannot efficiently distribute load across multiple frontend servers, limiting scalability when worker count is small relative to frontend server count.",
  "rootCause": "Pollers share a single connection and DNS round-robin only works with DNS-resolved addresses, not explicit address lists.",
  "proposedFix": "Support multiple addresses for explicit round-robin distribution or provide DNS-based round-robin via dns:/// prefix, with potential future support for weighted or fallback connection strategies.",
  "workaround": "Use dns:/// prefix for DNS-based round-robin or start more workers to distribute load evenly.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Immediate use case solved by documenting dns:/// prefix solution. PR #582 and #585 provide explicit multiple address support and documentation respectively.",

  "keyQuote": "DNS-based round-robin is already supported today, and we can add a small resolver to work with multiple addresses.",
