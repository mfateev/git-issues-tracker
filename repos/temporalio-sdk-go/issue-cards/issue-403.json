  "userImpact": "Developers cannot use standard Go error checking patterns like `errors.Is()` with activity errors, forcing them to use `errors.As()` and manual field comparison instead.",
  "rootCause": "Errors are reconstructed when crossing process boundaries, so the original error object identity is lost. Temporal errors don't implement `Is()` method, only `Unwrap()` and support for `errors.As()`.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement `Is()` method on Temporal error types that perform deep field comparison rather than pointer equality, while carefully handling cases like CanceledError and ApplicationError with varying fields.",
  "workaround": "Use `errors.As()` with type assertion instead of `errors.Is()`, or compare ApplicationError's message and type fields manually.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "By design - errors crossing process boundaries must be reconstructed, making pointer equality checks impossible. The maintainers clarified the correct approach using `errors.As()` instead.",

  "keyQuote": "The reason is that the process that called an activity and the process that implements the activity are frequently not the same... it is not really possible to return a Go error across process boundaries.",
