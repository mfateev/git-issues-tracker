  "userImpact": "Developers cannot easily pass context information to workflows during testing, requiring workarounds like custom context propagators.",
  "rootCause": "The testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment.ExecuteWorkflow method signature differs from the production Client.ExecuteWorkflow, lacking context.Context parameter support.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a ctx parameter to the mock variant of ExecuteWorkflow and propagate it through the test environment.",
  "workaround": "Use custom Context Propagators or Interceptors on worker options to inject context information in tests.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed due to lack of concrete use case. The issue reporter could not provide a concrete example of the use case without the test environment, and maintainers explained that context values cannot be injected into workflow context in the same way across distributed systems.",

  "keyQuote": "The code in my workflows/activities may rely on context information (e.g. user ID). So, in tests, it needs to be passed from somewhere",
