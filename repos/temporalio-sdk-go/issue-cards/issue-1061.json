  "summary": "Users accidentally pass workflow.Context instead of context.Context to activities, resulting in a confusing \"too few input arguments\" error. The SDK should warn when ExecuteActivity is called with a function that takes workflow.Context, helping users catch this common mistake and preventing accidental workflow invocations outside of workflow context.",

  "userImpact": "New users encounter confusing error messages when accidentally passing workflow.Context to activities, making debugging difficult and potentially indicating a logic error in their code.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK does not validate at call time whether an activity function's parameter types match expectations, specifically checking for workflow.Context which should never be used in activities.",
  "proposedFix": "Add runtime validation in ExecuteActivity to detect when a function takes workflow.Context as a parameter and provide a clear, helpful error message.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was likely addressed through improved type checking or validation in activity execution.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "A issue new users run into is they define an activity that takes a `workflow.Context` as a parameter, often just mistyping `context.Context`.",
