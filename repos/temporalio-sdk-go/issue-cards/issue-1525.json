  "rootCause": "Changing proto message serializer from gogoproto to proto.Message without a compatible deserializer causes the SDK to use the wrong deserialization method for previously serialized data.",

  "keyQuote": "if ListWorkflowExecutionsResponse was serialized with gogoproto as it was a gogoproto.message, by updating go.temporal.io ListWorkflowExecutionsResponse would now be a normal proto.Message so it would not use the gogoproto deserializer and fail.",
