  "summary": "The `temporal_activity_endtoend_latency` metric is redundant and misleading, duplicating the sum of `activity_scheduletostart_latency` and `activity_execution_latency`. It should measure the time from when an activity was first scheduled to when it completed successfully, requiring a fix to use `GetScheduledTime` instead of `GetStartedTime`.",

  "userImpact": "Users receive misleading metrics about activity execution latency, making it difficult to accurately monitor and diagnose activity performance issues.",
  "rootCause": "The metric uses `GetStartedTime` instead of `GetScheduledTime`, causing it to measure only execution latency rather than the full schedule-to-completion time.",
  "proposedFix": "Change the metric calculation in internal_task_pollers.go line 895 from using `GetStartedTime` to `GetScheduledTime`, and only record the metric when the activity completes successfully.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fix implemented to use `GetScheduledTime` and only record on successful completion, matching Java SDK changes from PR #800.",

  "keyQuote": "This metric is almost completely duplicative of `activity_scheduletostart_latency` + `activity_execution_latency` currently. It provides effectively no value and is misleading.",
