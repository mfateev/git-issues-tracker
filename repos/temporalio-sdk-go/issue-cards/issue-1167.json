  "userImpact": "Users cannot effectively test activities with execution times exceeding 10 minutes without using a real server, requiring additional boilerplate code and coupling to external test infrastructure.",

  "keyQuote": "Currently, the TestActivityEnvironment has a hard-coded 10 minute timeout. If I want to use the test suite to run an activity which takes longer than that, it fails with a timeout error.",
