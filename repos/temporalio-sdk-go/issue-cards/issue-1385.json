  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users may unknowingly write non-deterministic workflow code by reading RunId, causing workflow failures during reset scenarios without clear guidance.",
  "rootCause": "RunId property changes after workflow reset, making it non-deterministic. Child workflows without explicit IDs use SDK-generated IDs that include RunId, further compounding the issue.",
  "proposedFix": "Extend workflowcheck tool to detect reads of WorkflowExecution.RunId and suggest using WorkflowInfo.OriginalRunId or FirstRunId instead. Consider also detecting child workflow execution without explicit IDs.",
  "workaround": "Always explicitly set workflow IDs for child workflows and use OriginalRunId instead of RunId when determinism is required.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue closed by author after discovering related issue #723 and workaround. The tooling enhancement was not pursued as the underlying server work is not prioritized.",
