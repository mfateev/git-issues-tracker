  "summary": "User misconfigured a schedule by combining calendar-based constraints (weekdays 9am-5pm) with an interval-based constraint (every 4 minutes), causing runs to execute immediately and outside business hours. The issue was resolved when the user corrected their configuration to use only the calendar spec with the desired frequency.",

  "userImpact": "Users may incorrectly configure schedules by misunderstanding how calendar and interval specs compose, resulting in unintended execution timing.",
  "rootCause": "User combined two independent scheduling mechanisms (Calendars and Intervals) without understanding that they are unioned together, not intersected. The Intervals spec (every 4 minutes) executed independently of the Calendar constraints (weekdays 9am-5pm).",
  "proposedFix": "Move the 4-minute frequency constraint from a separate Intervals spec into the Calendar spec's Minute field with a Step parameter, so all constraints apply together.",
