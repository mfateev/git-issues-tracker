  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently batch redrive or restart workflows that are stuck in task queues without manual intervention for each workflow.",
  "rootCause": "CLI lacks support for batch workflow redriving and payload retrieval from workflow history for reuse in new executions.",
  "proposedFix": "Extend CLI with commands to batch start workflows by reusing input payloads, with support for query parameters and payload retrieval from workflow show output.",
  "workaround": "Use the UI's 'Start a workflow like this one' feature for individual workflows, or manually list workflows with --query and describe each one individually.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers indicated this is a feature request for the Temporal CLI project (not SDK-Go) and recommended using existing UI/CLI features. No plans to implement batch workflow redriving in SDK-Go.",
