  "userImpact": "Users with cached shared state on disk cannot maintain sessions across worker restarts without manual workarounds, limiting fault tolerance and operational flexibility.",
  "rootCause": "Current session implementation terminates sessions immediately when the owning worker restarts, without distinguishing between temporary restarts (e.g., version updates) and permanent failures.",
  "proposedFix": "Support special durable worker IDs that persist across restarts and introduce a timeout mechanism for automatic session re-establishment after worker restarts.",
  "workaround": "Create per-worker task queues and assign consistent task queue across restarts, or use a combination of sessions with per-worker task queues that allow workflow retry logic to select healthy workers.",

  "keyQuote": "For many use cases, a restart of a worker is not a problem as the shared state is cached on the host disk, and the session should continue as if nothing happened.",
