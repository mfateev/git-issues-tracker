  "userImpact": "Users expect local activities to be automatically retried when activity calls fail, but lack of explicit retry policy configuration prevents retries at the activity level.",
  "rootCause": "When retry options are nil, the code in internal_task_handlers.go prevents local activity retries, instead relying on workflow task retries.",
  "proposedFix": "Add default retry policy behavior for local activities similar to remote activities; add unit and integration tests to verify retry behavior.",
  "workaround": "Currently local activity failures are caught by workflow task retries, which retry until workflow timeout.",
