  "userImpact": "Users cannot safely reset workflows that use child workflows without explicitly specifying a child workflow ID, as the reset will cause non-deterministic errors during replay.",
  "rootCause": "Child workflow IDs are auto-generated based on the workflow's runID. When a workflow is reset, the runID changes, but the historical child workflow ID references remain based on the original runID, creating a mismatch during replay.",
  "proposedFix": "Generate child workflow IDs based on the workflow's OriginalRunId instead of the current runID, as the original runID remains constant across resets.",
  "workaround": "Explicitly specify child workflow IDs in the child workflow options to avoid SDK auto-generation.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed via PR #1803 which addresses the child workflow ID generation to handle resets correctly.",

  "keyQuote": "After reset, the workflow's runID changes but in workflow history the child workflow ID is still based on the original runID. Hence the not found and non-deterministic error.",
