  "summary": "SDK debug and error logs don't respect the logger from the interceptor chain, preventing users from adding custom fields (like trace IDs) to all workflow/activity execution logs. Users need a way to inject context-aware logging across all SDK-generated logs, not just user-initiated GetLogger calls.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot inject custom context (like trace IDs) into SDK-generated logs, limiting observability and incident response capabilities for distributed systems.",
  "rootCause": "SDK only invokes GetLogger on explicit user calls, not internally before emitting debug/error logs, so the interceptor chain cannot customize those logs.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a ContextAwareLogger interface that SDK calls before each log statement, or invoke GetLogger internally at key logging points to apply interceptor customizations.",
  "workaround": "Provide custom logger at client level, though this cannot access workflow/activity context for request-scoped fields.",
