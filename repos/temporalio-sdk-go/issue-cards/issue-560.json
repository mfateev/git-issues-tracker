  "userImpact": "Users providing custom workflow event history output must manually parse and transform Protobuf-derived HistoryEvent structures rather than working with idiomatic Go constructs.",
  "rootCause": "HistoryEvent is directly derived from Protobuf definitions for server compatibility, lacking Go-idiomatic helper methods or conversion utilities.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers decided to keep raw history for server compatibility but remain open to helper utilities. Issue closed without implementing full conversion to idiomatic Go structs.",

  "keyQuote": "The raw history does let us remain compatible with the server, but it might make sense to have helpers around either the history object or the iterator to extract certain things.",
