  "summary": "The Go SDK replayer cannot accept a custom workflow ID, causing child workflows with IDs derived from the parent's ID to fail during replay with non-determinism errors. The issue requests a way to set the workflow ID when replaying a history.",

  "userImpact": "Users testing workflows with dynamically derived child workflow IDs encounter false non-determinism errors during CI replay testing.",
  "rootCause": "The replayer uses 'ReplayId' as the workflow ID instead of accepting a custom execution ID from the history, causing child workflow ID derivations based on the parent ID to produce different values during replay.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow providing a custom execution ID (derived from recorded history filename) when replaying a history, as other Temporal SDKs support.",
  "workaround": "Record the workflow execution ID in a side-effect to make child workflow ID derivation deterministic.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The Go SDK was enhanced to support setting the workflow ID on the replayer, addressing the core issue.",

  "keyQuote": "Unlike our other SDKs, the Go SDK does not offer a way to set the workflow ID on the replayer.",
