  "userImpact": "Developers using dynamic workflow registration with `any` type maps cannot use workflowcheck static analysis without refactoring their registration code.",
  "rootCause": "Go static analyzer cannot determine runtime types of map values typed as `any`, limiting what workflowcheck can validate at compile time.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide a mechanism to allow users to ignore workflowcheck errors for dynamic registration patterns, or use type markers to enable static analysis of `any`-typed values.",
  "workaround": "Avoid converting functions to `any` type in the map; instead keep compile-time type information by registering workflows in a separate statement after retrieving them from the map.",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "We should let people ignore the workflowcheck registration-time analysis if the registration code is too dynamic for static analysis to discover.",
