  "summary": "Add opt-in support for visiting all payloads at once in the proxy visitor interceptor instead of handling them one set at a time. This enables users to apply transformations (like encryption/decryption) across all payloads collected from a proto message.",

  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Add an `AllAtOnce bool` option to `VisitPayloadsOptions` that causes a single visitor call with all collected payloads, with documentation requirements that output payloads must be 1:1 with input and `VisitPayloadsContext.Parent` will be nil.",
  "workaround": "Users can implement `CollectAllPayloads()` and `ApplyToAllPayloads()` utility functions as shown in the issue to gather payloads and apply transformations.",
