  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot invoke struct local activities using method value syntax (e.g., `a.GetGreeting`), forcing them to either initialize structs or use string-based activity lookup.",
  "rootCause": "Reflection cannot access the receiver pointer of method values, so the SDK cannot validate it's not nil or invoke the method safely through reflection.",
  "proposedFix": "Look up the function name in the activity registry and call it by registration, or require method expression syntax like `(*Activities).GetGreeting` instead of method values.",
  "workaround": "Users can initialize structs before calling local activities, or call activities by string name instead of method reference.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed by PR #436 with changes to how local activities handle method invocation and receiver validation.",

  "keyQuote": "The problem seems to be if you pass a 'method value' like `a.GetGreeting` there is no way to use reflection or anything else to access the receiver pointer",
