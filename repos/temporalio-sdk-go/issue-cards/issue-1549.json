  "summary": "User requests the ability to customize histogram buckets on a per-metric basis in the Go SDK. Currently, bucket configuration only applies globally through Tally's Reporter.RegisterTimer, making it impossible to customize buckets for specific metrics like temporal_activity_execution_latency_bucket without affecting all metrics.",
