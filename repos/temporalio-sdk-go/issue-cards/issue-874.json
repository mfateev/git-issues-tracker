  "userImpact": "Users cannot conveniently pass context.Done() to Worker.Run(), requiring workarounds or helper functions.",
  "rootCause": "Worker.Run() signature uses chan interface{} which is not compatible with chan struct{} due to Go's type system.",

  "workaround": "Create a top-level helper function that wraps Worker.Run() with a chan interface{}, or use Start()+Stop() for fine-grained control.",
