  "userImpact": "Users cannot detect deserialization failures when replaying workflows, making it impossible to validate workflow compatibility with different data formats.",
  "rootCause": "The replayer does not properly handle deserialization errors for workflow input during replay, silently skipping the workflow instead of propagating the error.",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Because of this, if there is a de-serialization problem we can't really test compatibility, as the replayer always returns nil.",
