  "summary": "Request to add built-in helpers for workflow.NewUUID() and workflow.NewRandom() to make it more convenient for workflow developers. Declined because the SDKs use deterministic seeded pseudorandom instead of side effects, and adding these helpers would codify API differences across SDKs without consensus.",
