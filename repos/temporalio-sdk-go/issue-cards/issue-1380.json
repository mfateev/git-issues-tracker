  "summary": "User reported that activity timeout was triggered approximately twice as early as the configured ScheduleToCloseTimeout value. Investigation revealed this is expected behavior: when an activity fails and retries with exponential backoff, if the next scheduled retry time exceeds the ScheduleToCloseTimeout, the activity fails immediately.",
