  "summary": "The `TemporalChangeVersion` search attribute accumulates values every time `getVersion` is called in Java and Go SDKs, causing the search attribute to exceed its size limit and trap workflows in WFT failure loops. The fix should either stop adding new versions or remove oldest ones when the limit is reached, with clear error/warning logging.",
