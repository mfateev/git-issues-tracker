  "summary": "The Worker API's Run() method takes a `<-chan interface{}` instead of accepting `context.Context`, making it inconvenient to use with Go contexts. The request seeks to simplify the API by having Run() accept context.Context directly, potentially replacing Start()/Stop() methods.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily use context.Context with Worker.Run() due to channel type incompatibility, requiring workarounds or awkward type conversions.",
  "rootCause": "Original API design used `<-chan interface{}` instead of `context.Context`, creating friction with standard Go patterns.",
  "proposedFix": "Change Worker.Run() to accept context.Context directly and remove Start()/Stop() methods as duplicates. Alternatively, at minimum update Run() to take context.Context. Users can use signal.NotifyContext() instead of InterruptCh().",
  "workaround": "Use signal.NotifyContext() for signal handling instead of InterruptCh(). Convert context to channel if needed.",
