  "userImpact": "Users cannot describe schedules when using custom remote data converters for encryption, blocking automation workflows.",
  "rootCause": "The codec HTTP endpoint calls protojson.Unmarshal on a null payload value without null-checking, causing a 'unexpected token null' proto syntax error.",
  "proposedFix": "Avoid calling the data converter with null payloads. Additionally, gracefully handle null payloads during deserialization by using zero values.",
  "workaround": "Downgrade to SDK version 1.30.0 before the user metadata summary feature was added.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The maintainers acknowledged the bug and committed to fixing both the null payload handling in the codec and graceful zero-value deserialization.",
