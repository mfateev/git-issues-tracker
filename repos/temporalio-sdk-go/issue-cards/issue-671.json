  "userImpact": "Go SDK users lack clear documentation on implementing authorization token handling, making it harder to secure their Temporal connections compared to other SDKs.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Documentation was created and a sample implementation was added to samples-go repository (serverjwtauth example) demonstrating custom header provider for JWT authentication.",
