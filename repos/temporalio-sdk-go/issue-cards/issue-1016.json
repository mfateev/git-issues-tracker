  "userImpact": "Users cannot safely update workflow code in long-running loops without complex workarounds that risk search attribute overflow.",
  "rootCause": "The memoized GetVersion API grows unboundedly when called multiple times in a loop with different version keys, making it unsuitable for iterative versioning in long-running workflows.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide a non-memoized version of GetVersion API similar to TypeScript SDK's patching API that can be used safely within loops.",
  "workaround": "Create wrapper function that reuses a single version key until max version is reached, then version per iteration; however this approach is unintuitive and can still fail with large search attributes.",
