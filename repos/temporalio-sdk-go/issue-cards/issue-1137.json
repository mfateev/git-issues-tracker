  "userImpact": "Users adopting OpenTelemetry are forced to integrate both OpenTelemetry and Tally metrics libraries, complicating their deployment configuration.",
  "rootCause": "SDK only supports Tally metrics; OpenTelemetry API was previously unstable but is now stable and widely adopted.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement OpenTelemetry metrics handler in the SDK to provide native support alongside or instead of Tally.",
  "workaround": "Implement the metrics.Handler interface to wrap OpenTelemetry (acknowledged as not ideal due to internal package exposure).",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "OpenTelemetry metrics implemented and released in separate contrib package (opentelemetry/v0.4.0), though subsequent versions revealed dependency incompatibilities with protobuf library versions.",
