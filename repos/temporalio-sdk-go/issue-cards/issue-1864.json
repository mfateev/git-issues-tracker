  "summary": "The SDK's Payload visitor doesn't properly handle repeated Any fields in protobuf messages. Currently it visits individual Any fields but fails to parse and visit through arrays/maps of Any values, such as the repeated Any field in MultiOperationExecutionFailure_OperationStatus in the Temporal API.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly visit and transform payloads nested within repeated Any fields, limiting payload transformation capabilities in complex error detail messages.",
  "rootCause": "The VisitPayloads visitor and proxy generator interceptor lack support for iterating through repeated/array Any fields, only handling singular Any fields.",
  "proposedFix": "Enhance the case handling in the proxy generator interceptor (around line 262 in interceptor.go) to properly traverse and visit repeated Any field elements.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was closed indicating the enhancement to support repeated Any fields was implemented in the api-go proxy generator.",
