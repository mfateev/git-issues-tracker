  "summary": "Worker Versioning-3 requires workflows to specify versioning behavior (either via default or per-workflow option), but the SDK doesn't validate this at registration time. This proposal adds registration-time validation to fail early when versioning behavior is missing, and removes the programmatic API for setting versioning behavior.",
