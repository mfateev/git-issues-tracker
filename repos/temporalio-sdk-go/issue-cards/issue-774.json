  "summary": "Memory leak occurs when a workflow is queried before being cached, causing the workflow to be reallocated on each query and accumulating goroutines. The issue is caused by intentional design where query-only tasks are not cached, combined with a goroutine leak in the query handling logic.",

  "userImpact": "Workflows queried repeatedly without prior cache initialization consume excessive memory, growing unbounded and requiring worker restarts to reclaim resources.",
  "rootCause": "Query-only tasks intentionally skip caching, requiring full history replay on each query. Additionally, a goroutine leak accumulates goroutines with each query execution.",
  "proposedFix": "Fix the goroutine leak in query handling (addressed in PR #779). Consider making query cache behavior configurable to allow opt-in caching for query-only tasks.",
  "workaround": "Either (1) disable workflow cache entirely with SetStickyWorkflowCacheSize(0), or (2) ensure first workflow interaction is a signal rather than a query to trigger caching.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "PR #779 fixed the goroutine leak in query handling. Query-only task caching remains intentional design for side-effect-free queries.",
