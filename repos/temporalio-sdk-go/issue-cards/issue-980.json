  "rootCause": "workflowcheck incorrectly marks fmt and reflect functions as non-deterministic due to deep call chains into runtime functions; the tool needs explicit whitelist or different analysis approach for stdlib formatting functions.",
  "proposedFix": "Explicitly mark fmt.Errorf, fmt.Sprintf and similar functions as deterministic, and consider reducing call-chain depth analysis to avoid reporting deep runtime implementation details.",
