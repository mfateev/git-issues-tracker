  "summary": "Temporal Go SDK v1.25.1 with grpc-gateway v1.16.0 is incompatible with bazel_gazelle 0.32+, causing build failures due to unresolved @go_googleapis repository references. The issue was resolved by upgrading to grpc-gateway v2.",

  "rootCause": "grpc-gateway v1.16.0 dependency uses proto imports that bazel_gazelle 0.32+ no longer automatically resolves to @go_googleapis, breaking the build dependency chain.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade to grpc-gateway v2, which is compatible with newer bazel_gazelle versions.",
  "workaround": "Add `build_naming_convention = \"go_default_library\"` to the `com_github_grpc_ecosystem_grpc_gateway` dependency and use older bazel_gazelle versions (0.31.1 or earlier).",
  "resolution": "fixed",
