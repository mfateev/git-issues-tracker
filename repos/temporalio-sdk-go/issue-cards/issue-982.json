The library requires activities to be registered before mocking, which is cumbersome for testing workflows with cross-language activities that lack Go function counterparts.",

  "userImpact": "Developers struggle to test workflows with cross-language activities and must create dummy functions to satisfy registration requirements before mocking.",
  "rootCause": "Local activities validate argument types at registration time rather than at dispatch time, making the registration check unnecessarily restrictive for mocking scenarios.",
  "proposedFix": "Drop the registration assertion for mock activities since OnActivity overrides the original function behavior entirely, making prior registration unnecessary.",
  "workaround": "Register a dummy function with the proper argument types before calling OnActivity, or use RegisterActivity with RegisterOptions.",
