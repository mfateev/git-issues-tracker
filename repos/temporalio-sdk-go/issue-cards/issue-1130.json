  "summary": "Request to expose the `taskLimiter` field of workers to allow dynamic rate limit adjustments at runtime. The proposal includes a reflection-based workaround demonstrating the use case, though maintainers clarified that the limiter has different behavior than expected and the proper solution requires tracking with issue #569.",

  "userImpact": "Users with fluctuating workloads cannot dynamically adjust worker task rates without restarting workers, limiting operational flexibility.",
  "rootCause": "The `taskLimiter` field is unexposed (private) in the worker implementation, preventing runtime rate adjustments.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose the `taskLimiter` field as public API to allow direct rate limit modifications at runtime, leveraging `rate.Limiter`'s mutex-based thread safety.",
  "workaround": "Maintain rate limits using external methods or restart workers, though these approaches lack flexibility.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers clarified that the limiter doesn't dynamically limit available slots as proposed—it only affects time processing after slots are used. The proper solution requires implementing issue #569, which addresses true dynamic slot management.",
