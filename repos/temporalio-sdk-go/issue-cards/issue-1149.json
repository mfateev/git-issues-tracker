Currently, keys like temporalWorkflowID, temporalRunID, and temporalActivityID are hardcoded with no configuration option, forcing users to create custom interceptors for simple key renaming.",

  "rootCause": "Trace attribute keys are hardcoded in the tracing interceptor with no configuration mechanism to override them.",
  "proposedFix": "Add key customization options to interceptor.TracerOptions and port them to opentelemetry.TracerOptions and opentracing.TracerOptions, allowing users to override default key names.",

  "keyQuote": "The only way to customise those keys is to create our own implementation of interceptor.Interceptor which is kind of heavy work to simply rename these keys.",
