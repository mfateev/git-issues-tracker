  "userImpact": "Users with context-aware data converters cannot properly decode workflow results when retrieving them via WorkflowRun.Get because interceptors cannot inject workflow-specific context at that point.",
  "rootCause": "The WorkflowRun.Get method does not support interceptors, unlike other client calls to workflow executions, making it impossible for context-aware data converters to access workflow-specific information during result deserialization.",
  "proposedFix": "Add interceptor support to WorkflowRun.Get, similar to the Java SDK's WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor.getResult() method.",

  "keyQuote": "With every other client call to a workflow execution this can be set in the interceptor, except for getting the workflow result because there is no interceptor.",
