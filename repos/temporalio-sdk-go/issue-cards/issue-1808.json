  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily attach business-related log fields to SDK-generated logs for workflows and activities without duplicating error logs or querying external systems.",
  "rootCause": "SDK internal logs are generated during task execution without access to runtime values provided during workflow/activity creation; interceptors can only be registered at worker initialization.",
  "proposedFix": "Add support for configuring extra log fields via StartWorkflowOptions and ActivityOptions, or enhance interceptor capabilities to access runtime values during GetLogger calls.",
  "workaround": "Users can implement custom log statements in their own interceptors, but this results in duplicate error logs and requires external system queries for activity contexts.",
  "resolution": "duplicate",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was marked as duplicate of #829, which addresses the broader feature of customizing internal logger use on a per-workflow basis.",
  "related": [
    829
  ],
  "keyQuote": "For those two log situations, you should consider using your own log statements in your own interceptor instead of relying on debug logs from the internals of the SDK.",
