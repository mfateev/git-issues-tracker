  "rootCause": "The constant was added as an SDK extension rather than being part of the official upstream API definition, creating potential compatibility concerns.",

  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The constant was moved to the upstream API and the SDK was updated to use the official API definition instead of the extension.",
