  "userImpact": "Users must manually convert JSON history to proto format and cannot specify workflow execution details when using file-based replay functions, creating friction in testing workflows.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Create a separate `LoadWorkflowHistoryFromJSONFile` function that returns a proto History object, which can then be used with `ReplayWorkflowHistoryWithOptions`. Also expose internal utility functions and SDK logger for test usage.",
  "workaround": "Users can implement their own JSON-to-proto conversion function and use `ReplayWorkflowHistoryWithOptions` directly with converted history, or implement custom logger interface.",
