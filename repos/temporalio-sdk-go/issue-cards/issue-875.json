  "userImpact": "Query handlers can currently perform unsafe mutating operations, breaking the semantic contract that queries should be read-only and not affecting workflow state.",
  "rootCause": "Query handler context lacks restrictions to prevent execution of activities and other mutating operations that should only occur in workflow code.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow query handlers to accept context as first parameter with backwards compatibility, disallow execute activity on that context, and add workflowcheck static analyzer check to enforce restrictions.",
