  "rootCause": "go.temporal.io/api v1.26.1 introduced breaking changes by deprecating gogoproto and switching to google.golang.org/protobuf types, which is incompatible with SDK v1.25.1 that still expects gogo types.",
  "proposedFix": "Either release a compatible SDK version with the new API, or prevent incompatible versions from being installed together through versioning constraints.",

  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The incompatible API version (v1.26.1) was retracted. The maintainers confirmed SDK versions are only compatible with specific API versions specified in their go.mod, and users should not update API independently.",
