  "userImpact": "Users running Go SDK clients in Docker containers cannot connect to Temporal servers using service names and must resort to manual DNS lookups or IP addresses.",
  "rootCause": "gRPC-go's default DNS resolver doesn't properly handle Docker's internal service discovery; the `passthrough:///` resolver is required for Docker container DNS names.",
  "proposedFix": "Use `passthrough:///temporal:7233` format for the HostPort option to bypass gRPC's DNS resolution logic.",
  "workaround": "Manually resolve the hostname using `net.LookupHost()` before passing the IP to client.Dial(), or use the `passthrough:///` resolver prefix.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Determined to be a documentation/configuration issue rather than a bug. The gRPC-go library is working as designed; users need to understand gRPC's name resolution rules and Docker's networking model.",
