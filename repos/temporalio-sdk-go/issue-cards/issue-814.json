  "summary": "workflowcheck tool fails to detect deadlocks and non-deterministic code violations when workflows contain sleep calls or other blocking operations. The tool should catch these violations but currently passes without errors, potentially masking runtime issues.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Developers cannot rely on workflowcheck to catch non-deterministic or blocking code in workflows, leading to runtime failures that pass static checks.",
  "rootCause": "workflowcheck does not properly detect blocking operations like time.Sleep that are outside Temporal-controlled runtime, and the history matching logic ignores non-event operations.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Use RegisterWorkflow as the entry point for workflowcheck analysis to catch issues, though this does not fully solve the detection problem.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Discussion clarified that sleep/print operations outside Temporal-controlled runtime are the issue. The tool limitations were acknowledged and the expected behavior of workflow validation was explained.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Workflow code is expected to run until all coroutines are yielded in a couple of milliseconds. This is important to worker scaling and replaying.",
