  "userImpact": "Users cannot configure a single caller-skip value that works consistently for both workflow and activity logging when using frameworks that auto-detect stack depth.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow logger is wrapped in a replay-safe version that adds an extra stack frame, while activity loggers are not similarly wrapped, creating an asymmetry in call stack depth.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a `WithCallerSkip` interface that loggers can implement to allow the SDK to adjust caller skip depth dynamically, maintaining backwards compatibility.",
  "workaround": "Adjust caller skip count differently for workflows vs activities in the logging framework configuration.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "A WithCallerSkip interface was implemented allowing loggers to adjust caller skip depth dynamically without breaking backwards compatibility.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The same log statements in workflow and activity should be at the same stack depth so that a shared caller-skip can work for both.",
