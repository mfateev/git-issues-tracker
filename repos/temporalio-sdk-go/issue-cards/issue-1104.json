  "summary": "ExecuteWorkflow's context timeout is being halved internally, causing workflows to timeout after half the user-specified duration. The issue stems from logic that halves the RPC timeout for retry purposes, but incorrectly applies this to the user-provided context deadline as well.",

  "rootCause": "The RPC timeout is correctly halved to allow retries within the user's context deadline, but the user-provided context timeout itself is being halved instead of only halving the RPC-level timeout.",
