  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily clean up unused activity registrations from workers, resulting in confusing error messages when those activities are no longer needed.",
  "rootCause": "User expected explicit de-registration API for activities, but the SDK design relies on simply not registering activities in subsequent worker deployments.",
  "proposedFix": "Use versioning to branch code and keep old activities registered only as long as workflows using them exist, then remove once migrated to new workflows.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer clarified that de-registration is implicit by not registering during worker startup. Recommended using versioning for gradual migration instead.",
