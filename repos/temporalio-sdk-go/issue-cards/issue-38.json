  "summary": "Workflow and activity type names currently include the full package path prefix (e.g., `go.temporal.io/temporal/internal.splitJoinActivityWorkflow`), which makes it difficult to move workflows between directories and requires manual string naming. The proposal is to remove the path prefix and use only the simple name (e.g., `splitJoinActivityWorkflow`).",
