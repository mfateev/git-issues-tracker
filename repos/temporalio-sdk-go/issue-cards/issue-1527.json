  "summary": "User requests the ability to return a CanceledError from an activity without it being treated as an unexpected error. Currently, the SDK wraps user-returned CanceledErrors in a generic error, causing them to be retried rather than marked as cancelled.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot elegantly represent non-error stop conditions in activities and must use non-retryable errors as a workaround.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK checks whether the context was actually cancelled by the server before accepting a CanceledError; if not cancelled server-side, the error is wrapped as unexpected and treated as a retriable error.",
  "proposedFix": "Stop checking that context is cancelled when handling a CanceledError returned from an activity.",
  "workaround": "Return a non-retryable error instead of CanceledError to represent the stop condition.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Server-side platform behavior prevents activities from being marked as cancelled unless the server issued the cancellation. The SDK correctly enforces this constraint by converting non-server-initiated cancellations to errors.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Activity cancellation can only result from the server issuing a cancellation, an activity cannot appear cancelled just by returning cancelled.",
