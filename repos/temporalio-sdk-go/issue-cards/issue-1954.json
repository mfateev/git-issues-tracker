  "summary": "User requests the ability to retrieve the original logger instance from activity.GetLogger(ctx) or workflow.GetLogger(ctx) instead of receiving a wrapped ReplayLogger. The issue is that injected context fields from custom loggers and trace interceptors are lost when the logger is wrapped.",

  "userImpact": "Users with custom logger implementations cannot reliably access their original logger instance with all injected context fields from interceptors and configurations.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK wraps the original logger in a ReplayLogger for activity/workflow execution, and the wrapped instance is not accessible to retrieve the original logger with its accumulated context fields.",
  "proposedFix": "Either provide a method to retrieve the original configured logger while preserving injected fields, or avoid wrapping the original logger and maintain the same logger type throughout execution.",
  "workaround": "Fall back to using a global logger, though this may result in loss of important context fields injected by interceptors.",
