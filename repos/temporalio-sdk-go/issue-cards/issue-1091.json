  "rootCause": "The SDK's JSON unmarshaling logic treats the workerVersioningId field as required and rejects null values instead of ignoring them, despite this field being optional in the serialized history.",
  "proposedFix": "Modify the JSON unmarshaling logic to ignore null values for optional fields like workerVersioningId, maintaining backward compatibility with history files from older Web UI versions.",

  "keyQuote": "While the ideal solution is probably to ensure that the Web UI does not include null attributes like these, the fact that there's a version in production that includes them means that the SDK probably needs to handle them",
