  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue closed as the existing test suite with RegisterDelayedCallback provides sufficient time control for testing purposes. Custom time sources in non-test environments are unreasonable due to server-side timeouts and other system dependencies.",

  "keyQuote": "controlling time in a non-test-environment workflow is unreasonable as many internal things such as timeouts rely on clocks you cannot substitute",
