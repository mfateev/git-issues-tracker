  "summary": "Calling `GetChildWorkflowExecution()` on a mocked child workflow in tests causes the child workflow to complete immediately instead of respecting the mocked delay. The parent workflow sees `IsReady() == true` immediately after calling `GetChildWorkflowExecution()` and sleeping, rather than waiting for the configured mock delay.",
