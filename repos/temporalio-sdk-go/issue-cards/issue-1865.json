  "summary": "The VisitPayloads function was not visiting repeated Payload fields nested within protobuf messages, causing visitor callbacks to be skipped for these payloads. This prevented proper traversal and mutation of payloads in structures like CountWorkflowExecutionsResponse_AggregationGroup.",
