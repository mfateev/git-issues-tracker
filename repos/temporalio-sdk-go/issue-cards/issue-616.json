Proposed solutions include adding gRPC metadata with server-measured durations and exposing lower-level gRPC stats to identify whether differences stem from interceptor overhead or HTTP/2 message handling.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot accurately measure and compare end-to-end latency between client and server, making it difficult to diagnose performance issues.",
  "rootCause": "Difference between client-measured latency (including serialization/interceptor operations) and server-measured latency; unclear which measurement point is authoritative.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose gRPC stats via dial options and implement server-side gRPC interceptor to include end-to-end duration in metadata for comparison and warning thresholds.",
  "workaround": "Use external profiling tools or metrics collectors to separately measure client and server latencies.",
