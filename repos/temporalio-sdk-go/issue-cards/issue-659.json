  "summary": "Exploration of deprecating the `Control` attribute used in signal external workflow and request cancel external workflow operations in the Go SDK. The `Control` field was inherited from Cadence SDK and contains an auto-incremented ID for internal state machine tracking, but its deprecation needs careful evaluation for compatibility concerns.",
