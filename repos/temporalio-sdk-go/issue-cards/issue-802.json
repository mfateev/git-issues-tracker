  "userImpact": "Users enabling OpenTracing cannot see workflow logs in their traces, limiting observability and debugging capabilities.",
  "rootCause": "The BaseTracer.GetLogger() method intentionally does not apply logs to traces by default, as the feature was designed to be opt-in via custom tracer implementations.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a custom tracer that overrides GetLogger to provide tracing-enabled logging, as mentioned in the default interceptor design.",
  "workaround": "Users can implement their own interceptor.Tracer wrapping/delegating to existing ones and provide a custom GetLogger implementation that attaches logs to traces.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The maintainer clarified this is intentional design - the default implementation does not attach logs to traces by default. Users needing this feature should implement a custom tracer.",
