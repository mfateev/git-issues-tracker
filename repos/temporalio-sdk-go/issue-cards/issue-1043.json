  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably determine task queue backlog size to implement dynamic worker autoscaling, forcing them to rely on indirect metrics or custom solutions.",
  "rootCause": "The `BacklogCountHint` field is an internal implementation detail that doesn't accurately reflect actual task queue depth and is not intended for user-facing scaling decisions.",
  "proposedFix": "Improve documentation to clarify that SDK-side slot metrics and server-side poll metrics should be used instead of `BacklogCountHint` for autoscaling decisions.",
  "workaround": "Use server-side poll metrics (poll success rate, available slots) and SDK-side slot metrics to infer when scaling is needed, rather than directly querying backlog size.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was addressed as a documentation/guidance matter. The `BacklogCountHint` is not suitable for scaling; users should use poll success metrics and slot utilization instead.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "the hint may not reflect that value. I am getting details on that value now, but it is a mostly internal value that you should not use for scaling workers.",
