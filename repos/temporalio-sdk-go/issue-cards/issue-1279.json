  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot currently correlate gRPC client spans with workflow execution spans, limiting observability and debugging capabilities.",
  "rootCause": "No public API exists to extract trace parent data (_tracer-data header) from workflow proto request/response payloads.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide a function to extract traceparent data from request/response objects, or expose trace context through existing interceptor mechanisms.",
  "workaround": "Use a ClientInterceptor after the OpenTelemetry interceptor to manually extract span context and add workflow trace IDs as attributes.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer indicated the architecture doesn't support this pattern as spans are deserialized and used by other worker processes. Workaround provided using standard OpenTelemetry interceptor patterns.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The spans in the interceptors are deserialized and used by other worker processes to re-parent their spans.",
