  "userImpact": "Workers silently fail to process workflows when misconfigured with a concurrent poller limit of 1, causing complete workflow execution stalls.",
  "rootCause": "Worker's preference for sticky queue polling causes it to never poll from the normal queue when MaxConcurrentWorkflowTaskPoller is limited to 1, creating a deadlock scenario.",
  "proposedFix": "Either implement smarter queue polling that periodically polls from the normal queue, or enforce a minimum of 2 workflow task pollers and fail worker startup with clear error message if constraint violated.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was resolved by implementing intelligent queue polling strategy that balances sticky queue preferences with normal queue polling.",
