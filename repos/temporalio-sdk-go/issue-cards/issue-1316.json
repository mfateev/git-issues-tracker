  "summary": "Request to add GetUnhandledUpdateNames to allow catch-all handlers for updates in workflows, similar to GetUnhandledSignalNames for signals. Discussion concluded that a more generic dynamic handler approach would be better suited for updates due to their different API and timing requirements compared to signals.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot currently implement a catch-all handler for workflow updates, limiting flexibility in handling unexpected update types compared to signal handling.",
  "rootCause": "Updates API lacks the equivalent catch-all mechanism that exists for signals (GetUnhandledSignalNames), and directly mimicking signals is not appropriate due to different API behavior and execution timing.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a dynamic handler registration mechanism for updates that allows a catch-all handler to run before the main workflow function, better suited to updates' API and behavior than mimicking the signals approach.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Merged into issue #997 which implements a more appropriate dynamic handler solution per features#201 requirements.",

  "keyQuote": "I don't think we should mimic the signal approach since updates and signal have very different APIs and behavior in the Go SDK.",
