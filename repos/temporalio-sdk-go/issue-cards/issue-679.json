  "userImpact": "Developers debugging workflow panics must use undocumented error unwrapping patterns instead of clean, standard Go error handling practices.",
  "rootCause": "PanicError.StackTrace() is only available on activity errors, not exposed at the workflow error level, requiring manual error type unwrapping.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide a documented way to access stack traces from workflow panics, potentially through a method on WorkflowExecutionError or clearer documentation of errors.As() usage pattern.",
  "workaround": "Use errors.As() to extract the underlying PanicError: `var panicErr *temporal.PanicError; if errors.As(err, &panicErr) { panicErr.StackTrace() }`",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue resolved by maintainer providing the standard Go errors.As() pattern as the recommended solution, which is cleaner than manual type casting.",
