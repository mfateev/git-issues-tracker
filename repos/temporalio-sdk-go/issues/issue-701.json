Please describe.**\r\n\r\nServer capabilities are needed for some things like knowing whether to retry certain classes of error\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n* Remove health checking and options (including removing the ability to disable health check)\r\n  * This was a subject of much debate, but lazy capabilities lookup is difficult and having a way to opt-out of getting server capabilities is troublesome\r\n  * This causes those that were traditionally using the disable-health-check option to have lazy client connectivity to rework their approach\r\n* Upon client creation, instead of health check, call `getServerInfo` to obtain server capabilities\r\n  * Make sure 404's are handle gracefully as though none of the capabilities were set\r\n  * Errors besides 404, such as server not available, cause client creation to fail just like default health checks do. The difference is we don't have a client-side backoff capability, we fail fast.\r\n* Leverage the `internal_error_differentiation` capability to, if true, stop gRPC retrying internal errors","closedAt":"2022-03-01T19:42:10Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-01-20T23:04:06Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":701,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Implement server capabilities and replace health check","updatedAt":"2022-03-01T19:42:10Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/701"}
