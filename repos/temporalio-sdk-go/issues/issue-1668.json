While it may seem like inside a workflow this panic is the users fault for accessing typed search attributes, it is not the users fault when simply describing the workflow. We might as well just ignore all invalid values. This is confirmed to be the behavior in Python (didn't confirm elsewhere).\r\n\r\nThis was most obvious when a user used the TypeScript SDK to create a schedule that has a workflow action with its search attributes as a single item array (the only form TypeScript SDK supports at this time since it lacks typed search attributes). Then the user did a `temporal schedule describe` in CLI which panics.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-10-11T13:07:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":1668,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"When deserializing typed search attributes, invalid values should be ignored","updatedAt":"2024-10-11T13:07:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1668"}
