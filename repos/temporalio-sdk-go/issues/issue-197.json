I called continueasnew with the function pointer to Workflow1's execution method, and the continueasnew operation resulted in Workflow2 kicking off (!) as a part of Workflow1's execution, which confused the heck out of me. \r\n\r\nI fixed this locally by referencing the friendly workflow name I registered with instead of the function pointer, but: \r\n\r\n1) If two separate workflows in different packages cannot have the same function name, we should ideally be crashing the worker on startup.\r\n\r\n2) If this is supposed to be supported behavior, then there is a bug here.\r\n\r\nTested locally against latest Temporal and SDK bits as of 7/16/2020 and reproduces quite easily.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5552381/87704513-5cb70c80-c751-11ea-969d-12dd7d5d4bc4.png)\r\n\r\n(Note lines 107 and 115 register two different workflows with same entry method name, which causes the issue)","closedAt":"2023-05-24T07:44:24Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6847UCoX","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is the expected behavior of the registration, though it is possible at the time of this issue it may have been broken or otherwise not implemented right. Today it is accepted that the simple function name is used as the name and you have to use the options to override it with a different name.
