Please describe.**\r\nI have to send signal to different namespaces, but temporal client only allows to send signal to workflows in same namespace\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n[SignalWorkflow](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/6580cbe0aa41a8b515791f95c2c15bb37db1dab1/internal/internal_workflow_client.go#L341-L365) just passes the namespace of client. May be we can encode the namespace to context (WtihWorkflowNamespace, just like workflow version), and use namespace in SignalWorkflow function (if exists).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCurrent solution to send signal to different namespace using custom workflow, where I send the signal to different namespace.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIt is possible to send the signal to different namespaces within workflow, using [WithWorkflowNamespace](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/6580cbe0aa41a8b515791f95c2c15bb37db1dab1/workflow/workflow_options.go#L39-L42).
