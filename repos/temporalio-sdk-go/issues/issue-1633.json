The motivation for this is that, given appropriate tools, it will make it easier for us to study patterns of flakiness, test timings etc, across matrix builds within a run, and across runs. Producing the files now will allow us to test tools for doing this.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-09-12T09:55:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1633,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Modify test suite to dump junit XML","updatedAt":"2024-09-12T09:55:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1633"}
