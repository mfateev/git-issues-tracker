It is especially useful to have these handy in sdk failure logs.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nIf traces are samples, user logs contain trace-id and span-id as log tags, but sdk logs do not contain either.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n  1. Initialize an otel tracing interceptor with \"go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentelemetry\" `opentelemetry.NewTracingInterceptor` and add to client options\n\n## Specifications\n  - Version: `v1.35.0`\n\n## Related\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1273\n","closedAt":"2025-10-01T16:41:00Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w687IG06m","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The interceptor already does attach trace and span ID for user created logger.\n\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/aecdca8be43def99f6237a07385f58612869cd65/contrib/opentelemetry/tracing_interceptor.go#L219","createdAt":"2025-10-01T16:41:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2061#issuecomment-3357232806","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w687IG4Mx","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"There is a separate issue for using the intercepted logger for all SDK logs https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/829 as well.
