This is due to https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1875.\n\nThe solution should be to also keep the worker stop channel in the Local Activity poller and have GetWorkerStopChannel() return that, while also ensuring shutdown behaves properly and the LA specific stop channel is closed at the right time.\n\nOnce this is fixed, see TODO comment linking this issue in integration tests and have Local Activity wait on that channel closure, instead of a manual time wait, to avoid potential race conditions\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n  1.\n  1.\n  1.\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version:\n  - Platform:\n","closedAt":"2025-06-26T01:44:56Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-30T19:08:55Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDg2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1963,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"GetWorkerStopChannel no longer indicates worker shutdown for Local Activities","updatedAt":"2025-06-26T01:44:56Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1963"}
