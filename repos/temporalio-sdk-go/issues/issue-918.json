Please describe.**\r\nI'm writing unit test for my code and need a way to mock ExecuteWorkflow method.

Can we also define this for internal.WorkflowClient?\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2022-12-02T19:12:34Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685K_hhh","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"You should mock the `client.Client` interface with your favorite mocking approach.
