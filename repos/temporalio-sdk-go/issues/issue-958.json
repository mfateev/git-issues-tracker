Therefore most interfaces that are used like sum types, like our `ScheduleAction`, expect the concrete types to be pointers so the developer cannot have both pointer and non-pointer options.\r\n\r\nToday, `ScheduleAction` can be set to `ScheduleWorkflowAction` _or_ `*ScheduleWorkflowAction`, but the latter fails at runtime. I think maybe we should always _require_ `*ScheduleWorkflowAction` by changing receiver to `func (*ScheduleWorkflowAction) isScheduleAction()`.","closedAt":"2022-11-15T23:24:25Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685OcLQ2","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"closed in https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/959","createdAt":"2022-11-15T23:24:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/958#issuecomment-1316009014","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-11-15T15:02:16Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":958,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Confusing interface match for client.ScheduleWorkflowAction","updatedAt":"2022-11-15T23:24:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/958"}
