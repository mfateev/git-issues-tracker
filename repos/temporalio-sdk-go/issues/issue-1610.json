Please describe.**\r\nThe `worker.WorkflowReplayer` [interface](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/worker#WorkflowReplayer) does not have the `GetWorkflowResult` method on it, even though [the underlying WorkflowReplayer struct does](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.28.1/internal#WorkflowReplayer.GetWorkflowResult).\r\n\r\nI am using this to build a test helper to replay workflows and ensure that their results are the same each time, and so I currently need to to my own interface assertion to get access to this method:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype replayerWithResults interface {\r\n\tworker.WorkflowReplayer\r\n\r\n\t// GetWorkflowResult returns the result of a workflow execution.\r\n\t//\r\n\t// For replays, the workflowID will always be \"ReplayId\".\r\n\t//\r\n\t// https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.28.1/internal#WorkflowReplayer.GetWorkflowResult\r\n\tGetWorkflowResult(workflowID string, valuePtr any) error\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt's a bit challenging to make this a completely backward compatible change, since this API is returning an interface rather than a concrete type.\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would switch to returning the WorkflowReplayer struct directly from e.g. `NewWorkflowReplayerWithOptions`, so that new methods can be added backward-compatibly.  However, I think that ship has sailed, so there are a few options:\r\n* **Create a new API that returns the concrete type, e.g. `NewWorkflowReplayerWithResults`.**\r\n* Expose the internal.WorkflowReplayer type via a type alias so that users can type assert the type directly, and promise that this is the type that will be returned from these constructors.\r\n* Create another interface (e.g. `WorkflowReplayerWithResults`) and document that it will be returned from these constructors.\r\n* Document that the returned type has additional methods that users can use in their own interfaces and what they are.\r\n\r\nI think the first one is probably the optimal one from a user standpoint, but the second one is likely to be close enough, and it is future proof in a way that the final two are not.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-08-27T21:49:59Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1610,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Provide access to the workflow results from worker.WorkflowReplayer","updatedAt":"2024-08-27T21:53:56Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1610"}
