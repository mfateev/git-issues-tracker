I was studying the hello world example, and was thrown for a loop by the fact that you need to [create a client to create a worker](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/main/helloworld/worker/main.go), but then that client is effectively ignored afterwards, and another client is created and used separately [to actually invoke the workflow](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/main/helloworld/starter/main.go).","createdAt":"2021-11-11T23:48:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/618#issuecomment-966705705","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6845pkp2","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@ibeckermayer - There may be a bit of confusion.
