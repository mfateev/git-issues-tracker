Please describe.**\r\nIt would be nice to have an option to configure the logging keys for the tracing interceptor. Currently the keys are hardcoded and it makes it harder to keep the logging consistent with other components in my system. What do you think?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/contrib/opentelemetry/tracing_interceptor.go\r\n```go\r\ntype TracerOptions struct {\r\n        ...\r\n    \tLoggingTraceIDKey string \r\n\tLoggingSpanIDKey string\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhere by default `LoggingTraceIDKey=\"TraceID\"`, `LoggingSpanIDKey=\"SpanID\"`\r\n```go\r\nfunc (t *tracer) GetLogger(logger log.Logger, ref interceptor.TracerSpanRef) log.Logger {\r\n\tspan, ok := ref.(*tracerSpan)\r\n\tif !ok {\r\n\t\treturn logger\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tlogger = log.With(logger,\r\n\t\ttracer.options.LoggingTraceIDKey, span.SpanContext().TraceID(),\r\n\t\ttracer.options.LoggingSpanIDKey, span.SpanContext().SpanID(),\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n\treturn logger\r\n}\r\n```\r\nor something similar to that.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThere is probably a workaround to create another interceptor which would basically does the same thing but it would use different keys and it would be responsible for mapping. So there would be all keys (default + custom).\r\n","closedAt":"2024-06-08T21:04:52Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686AUwOE","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"All logging keys can also be changed by the `logger` implementation.
