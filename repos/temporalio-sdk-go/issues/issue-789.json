Please describe.**\r\n\r\nPeople want to see results for that execution, but if `WorkflowExecutionCompletedEventAttributes.new_execution_run_id` is set, we automatically follow to the next one. This sucks for things like wanting to get an older cron result.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAllow users to opt-out of \"follow runs\" like we do in other languages. It is still up in the air on how best to provide that option to the `client.WorkflowRun.Get` call without breaking backwards compat (new call adds method to the iface, context value is ugly but may be best here).","closedAt":"2022-05-02T21:27:28Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-04-22T19:48:03Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":789,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Allow getting workflow result to not follow runs","updatedAt":"2022-05-02T21:27:28Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/789"}
