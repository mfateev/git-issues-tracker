A sane timeout default and an option to configure it should be provided.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nThe client hangs while running a query for a workflow execution that is not available (ex: panicking). We tried setting the `QueryRejectCondition` option to different values with no success. The client still hangs forever.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, making the same query through `tctl` will timeout in 5 seconds. This means that the `tctl` codebase does have a default timeout of 5 seconds and the Go SDK does not.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Create a workflow that can panic or that can be unavailable for some reason.\r\n  2. Create a query within the workflow\r\n  3. Run the workflow and make it panic\r\n  4. Use the Go client to run the query for that workflow and see how it hangs\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.4.1\r\n  - Platform: Linux 5.7.0-0.bpo.2-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.7.10-1~bpo10+1 (2020-07-30) x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-06-30T21:40:45Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":482,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Workflow query hangs if the temporal workflow execution panics (is not available)","updatedAt":"2021-06-30T21:40:45Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/482"}
