Go errors are often short on this kind of information when just printed directly and encourage logging or explicit error extraction to fill in the gaps here. If we are not logging information that we should, we can make sure we do.","createdAt":"2024-02-26T15:30:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1395#issuecomment-1964424601","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-02-22T20:39:03Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1395,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Make TestWorkflowEnvironment return errors with stack traces","updatedAt":"2024-02-26T15:30:28Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1395"}
