The main reasons are to group all implementations under the same roof and to provide more active contribution from the community as the original repository was archived several years ago.\n\nThe dependency URL should be modified to point to the new repository URL. The tag \"v0.9.0\" was applied at the point of transfer and will reflect the exact code that was frozen in the original repository.\n\nIf you are using Go modules, you can update to the exact point of transfer using the @v0.9.0 tag in your go get command.\n```\ngo mod edit -replace github.com/codahale/hdrhistogram=github.com/HdrHistogram/hdrhistogram-go@v0.9.0\n```\n\n## Performance Improvements\n\nFrom the point of transfer, up until now (mon 16 aug 2021), we've released 3 versions that aim support the standard HdrHistogram serialization/exposition formats, and deeply improve READ performance. \nWe recommend to update to the latest version.\n","closedAt":"2024-06-13T14:31:32Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686BGECr","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as no longer needed","createdAt":"2024-06-13T14:31:27Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/517#issuecomment-2165850283","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-08-16T00:42:02Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":517,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"codahale/hdrhistogram repo url has been transferred under the github HdrHstogram umbrella","updatedAt":"2024-06-13T14:31:32Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/517"}
