This gives extra \r\nflexibility for dynamic workflows but can be error-prone.\r\n\r\nThis issue suggests an alternative approach which associates a default behavior to a workflow type, using a new option for workflow registration.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd the option `DefaultVersioningBehavior` to `workflow.RegisterOptions`, providing a default behavior for all workflows of a particular type that do not use the programmatic API.\r\n","closedAt":"2024-12-03T20:14:58Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-10-30T21:09:50Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1698,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Enable type-scoped Versioning Behavior for workflows  ","updatedAt":"2024-12-03T20:14:58Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1698"}
