Therefore any `RetryPolicy` the worker needs to be able to serialize and send them to Temporal. We can't serialize an arbitrary function.\r\n\r\nI  think a feature like is described here https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/806 would be a more feasible alternative.","createdAt":"2023-10-11T12:35:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1257#issuecomment-1757590728","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-10-04T12:07:00Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1257,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Allow RetryPolicyOptions to take a predicate (function) to evaluate whether to retry or not","updatedAt":"2023-11-12T07:45:49Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1257"}
