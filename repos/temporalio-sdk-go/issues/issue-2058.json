Please describe.**\nNew panic policy to reset the workflow from the start in case of panic/non-determinism. Full discussion [here](https://community.temporal.io/t/catching-nondeterministicexception/5020/10?u=_elbek_khoshimjonov).\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nNew option called `ResetWorkflow` [here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/aecdca8be43def99f6237a07385f58612869cd65/worker/worker.go#L249-L259)\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nWith `WorkflowPanicPolicy` set to `worker.FailWorkflow`\nAnd `RetryPolicy` set to some value when starting a workflow allows us to restart the workflow when the workflow encounters non-deterministic panics.\n\n**Additional context**\nThe solution I had in mind has some caveats:\n- Any panic in the workflow will result in a restart, and if the workflow code does not handle the issue, there might be an infinite loop. (Some kind of maximum limit should be set.)\n\nThe alternative solution I have described has a few caveats:\n- Any real errors returning from the workflow to terminate the workflow must be wrapped with `temporal.NewNonRetryableError`\n- Workflow retry does not seem to replay the signals (which we want for our use case)\n","closedAt":"2025-09-26T19:39:25Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w687HF7-k","author":{"login":"elb3k"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Duplicate of https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/417","createdAt":"2025-09-26T19:39:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2058#issuecomment-3340222372","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-09-26T19:34:38Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2058,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"ResetWorkflow panic policy","updatedAt":"2025-09-26T19:39:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2058"}
