Please describe.**\n\nI've implemented my workflows on a struct and the workflow funcs have a pointer receiver. This may have lead to errors and it's possible to detect this with static code analysis to avoid this programming error in the future.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nThe `workflowcheck` command should report this.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nImplementing a custom linter seems unnecessary since `workflowcheck` already exists. Its name also leaves room for analysis beyond determinism.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nAs discussed here https://community.temporal.io/t/go-sdk-non-deterministic-error/12393\n","closedAt":"2025-07-16T16:57:05Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6860CKtC","author":{"login":"yuandrew"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for opening this issue! `workflowcheck` is a tool that's used to check for non-deterministic code, and we don't plan on expanding that scope today.\n\nAfter discussing with the team, we decided it makes sense to add a warn log here, so at least at registration time users will receive a log about this issue.
