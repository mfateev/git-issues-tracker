Please describe.**\nIn some scenarios, a local activity is used to log the whole state of a workflow on every change. As the state is large the history becomes very big. The local activity input is included in the marker event only for human consumption and is not used by the SDK. \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd `LocalActivityOption.DoNotIncludeArgumentsIntoHistory` option.
