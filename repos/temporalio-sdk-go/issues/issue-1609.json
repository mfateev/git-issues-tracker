Are there any plans on implementing this (and if there are, is there an approximate ETA for it) or is this issue left for outside developers to contribute?\n\nIn our project we use custom errors and error marshalling from https://github.com/cockroachdb/errors. Right now we are managing with a custom FailureConverter but lacking context stands in a way of, for example, logging the problems with marshalling/unmarshalling using the right logger.\n\nThank you!","createdAt":"2025-09-09T14:21:35Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1609#issuecomment-3270970229","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-08-27T14:42:09Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1609,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Support ContextAware for failure converters","updatedAt":"2025-09-09T14:21:36Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1609"}
