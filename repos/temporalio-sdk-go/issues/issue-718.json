Please describe.**\r\nIf users want to set an alert for activities that keep retrying and failing, there is no appropriate metric to handle that.\r\n`activity_succeed_endtoend_latency` includes only successful executions.\r\n`activity_execution_latency` handles the execution of a single activity task only.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should add a metric reporting how much time passed from an activity schedule to the last activity attempt. This metric should have an activity type as a tag and be SDK side.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUsers can produce their own custom metrics.
