Gonna close this, but feel free to comment/reopen w/ more discussion.\r\n\r\nBasically we encourage use of side effects for \"new UUID\" and similar randomness, but this isn't what we're doing in other SDKs (they use run-specific seeded pseudorandom to get deterministic UUIDs) and we fear codifying the difference in API.\r\n\r\nIf we do want that kind of random/uuid API, we need to remove the recommendation to use side effects and then add the API.
