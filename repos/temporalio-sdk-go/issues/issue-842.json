This would allow a custom processor to check if `processContext.Current` was `*commonpb.Header` and just not call `processContext.Next()` like it would for the others.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685Ft3c_","author":{"login":"robholland"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Can you give some example consumers for this API?","createdAt":"2022-06-29T07:52:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/842#issuecomment-1169651519","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685Ft31k","author":{"login":"robholland"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I guess I'm wondering why not just pass a list of types to skip?","createdAt":"2022-06-29T07:53:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/842#issuecomment-1169653092","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685FvH5S","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> Can you give some example consumers for this API?\r\n\r\nUsers who want to only skip tracing headers\r\n\r\n> I guess I'm wondering why not just pass a list of types to skip?\r\n\r\nNo reason to make it purposefully less flexible.
