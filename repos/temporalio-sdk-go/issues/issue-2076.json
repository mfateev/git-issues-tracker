Please describe.**\nWe're using SideEffects a lot and from a user perspective it's very hard to navigate the workflow timeline when there are 10-20 side effects in a row. The only way to see what was called there is to check the payload and try to understand which method could return this payload.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd SideEffectOptions with Name parameter \nPR https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/2074\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nChecked if that can be implemented on UI side, by using MutableSideEffect with IDs, but those IDs are not shown in the timeline as well. Considered building Chrome extension to fetch MutableSideEffects's IDs in the UI, but overriding marker names in SDK is the cleanest solution.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nSolution that didn't work well - mutable side effects - you have to expand each of them, so there's not much benefit when reading a timeline.\n\n<img width=\"2650\" height=\"1004\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42ae6caa-6314-4080-9ebd-aea9bfd47226\" />\n\n\nMy [proposed](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/2074) solution - name override, it's shown in the timeline.\n\n<img width=\"903\" height=\"588\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cdaebff-8f92-4650-be73-d18898a82d85\" />\n","closedAt":"2025-10-20T16:36:27Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w687K5Kr_","author":{"login":"yuandrew"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for the issue! I agree having a bunch of `SideEffect`s in a row in the UI is not helpful.
