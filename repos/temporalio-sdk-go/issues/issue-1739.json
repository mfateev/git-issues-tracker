The worker can specify a default, \r\nbut if there is no default, and it is not provided as an option for that workflow, \r\nit should fail. \r\n\r\nThe current server implementation ignores the `UseVersioning` flag\r\nand relies on missing behavior info to disable versioning. Therefore,\r\nthe server cannot fail the task, it has to be the SDK...\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed does two things:\r\n- Removes the programmatic API to set versioning behavior. It is fragile, there \r\nis not a clear use case for the flexibility added, and makes it hard to fail workflows early (without side-effects).\r\n- Add a check at workflow type registration to fail registration when there is no default, and no value provided.\r\n","closedAt":"2024-12-16T14:58:55Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-12-03T02:49:51Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1739,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Fail registration of workflow types without versioning behavior","updatedAt":"2024-12-16T14:58:55Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1739"}
