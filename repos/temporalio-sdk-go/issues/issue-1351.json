Please describe.**\r\nWhen using a context aware data converter that uses the workflow ID (or any workflow options), the workflows result will be encoded using the workflow ID. When reading the workflow result the data converter must also have the workflow ID passed. With every other client call to a workflow execution this can be set in the interceptor, except for getting the workflow result because there is no interceptor.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSupport interceptor on `WorkflowRun.Get`\r\n\r\nJava SDK Also supports it:\r\n\r\nhttps://javadoc.io/static/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/1.22.3/io/temporal/common/interceptors/WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor.html#getResult(io.temporal.common.interceptors.WorkflowClientCallsInterceptor.GetResultInput)\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685ws4dH","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"related: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1349","createdAt":"2024-01-14T01:15:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1351#issuecomment-1890813767","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685w4STT","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Note, many other SDKs (TS, Python, and .NET) do not support intercepting result fetching. Java is unique here. Most, including Go, support wrapping the result from start to customize result fetching. But as for manually getting a workflow run/handle, only Java seems to be able to do this. If we agree we need this functionality generally we can create a general purpose feature for it so those SDKs can add it too. \r\n\r\nI am not sure SDKs are usually expected to be able to use workflow-specific information in all ways a data converter is invoked by a client.
