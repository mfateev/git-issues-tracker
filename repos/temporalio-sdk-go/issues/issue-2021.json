Please describe.**\nWe're having some issues in our application when deploying a new version where the worker will wait for the activity to finish but in a session it won't wait until the session is manually closed. We will get a heartbeat timeout and then the workflow fails.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nThe option to configure for a worker to wait until all open sessions are closed before shutting down.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nManually keeping a count of the open sessions and wait until there are 0 open before invoking the shut down. However there doesn't seem to be a way to stop scheduling new sessions on a given worker.\n\n","closedAt":"2025-08-26T16:33:01Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686-mrrp","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@renescheepers I transferred the issue to sdk-go since this is an SDK side feature.","createdAt":"2025-08-18T17:27:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2021#issuecomment-3197811433","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-08-13T18:04:02Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2021,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Graceful worker shutdown of sessions","updatedAt":"2025-08-26T16:33:01Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2021"}
