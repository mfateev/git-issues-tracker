Please describe.**\r\nWhen registering workflows/activities in a worker, consumers often don't need the Start and Stop methods of the worker interface.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nDefine a `Registry` or a `WorkerRegistry` interface in the worker package with the registration methods and embed it in the worker interface. Consumers can use this interface instead of the `Worker` interface. Although in Go consumers usually own interfaces, in this case the interface and the use case is well-defined by the provider, so it makes sense to define it in the worker package.\r\n","closedAt":"2020-11-08T01:22:09Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjcwNDAyMg==","author":{"login":"sagikazarmark"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Further thinking about this, I'd also consider splitting the methods up to `WorkflowRegistry` and `ActivityRegistry`.","createdAt":"2020-11-05T23:28:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/280#issuecomment-722704022","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMjc2MDczOA==","author":{"login":"mfateev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"PR is welcome","createdAt":"2020-11-06T02:01:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/280#issuecomment-722760738","viewerDidAuthor":true}],"createdAt":"2020-11-05T21:24:41Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":280,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add a Registry/WorkerRegistry interface to the worker package","updatedAt":"2020-11-08T01:22:09Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/280"}
