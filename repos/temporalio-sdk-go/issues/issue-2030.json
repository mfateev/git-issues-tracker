To avoid compatibility issues, the upstream API definition of the enum should have this constant added (with the next ordinal integer value and without `EXT` in the name). After that, the SDK code should be changed to remove the extension constant and use the constant in upstream API instead.","closedAt":"2025-09-02T14:51:26Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-08-26T14:59:43Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":2030,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Move RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED_CAUSE_EXT_GRPC_MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE to upstream API","updatedAt":"2025-09-02T14:51:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2030"}
