{"assignees":[],"author":{"id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODM5MDQ=","is_bot":false,"login":"tomwheeler","name":"Tom Wheeler"},"body":"## Expected Behavior\r\nWhile reading the Go SDK documentation on [Activity Cancellation](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.20.0/activity#hdr-Activity_Cancellation), I found myself confused by repeated mentions of Task Tokens and Asynchronous Activities. I then realized that this was because I had continued to the next section, which was missing the heading. Instead, what should have been a heading (\"Async/Manual Activity Completion\") was shown as regular text.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2183904/214463269-1a35ffdb-df48-4d37-86b5-38809d4d7e7a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Navigate to the [Activity Cancellation](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.20.0/activity#hdr-Activity_Cancellation) section of the Go SDK 1.20.0 documentation\r\n  2. Observe the \"Activity Cancellation\" heading, which is displayed as it should be (bold black text on a light blue background), as depicted in the screenshot above.\r\n  3. Observe the \"Async/Manual Activity Completion \" text, which is displayed as plain text instead of a heading (also visible in the screenshot above)\r\n\r\nI suspect that the slash disqualifies this text as an implicit heading, and therefore prefixing [that line](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/v1.20.0/activity/doc.go#L117) with `# ` to make it an explicit heading might fix it.\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.20.0\r\n  - Platform: macOS (but this is not relevant since it's not a client-side issue)\r\n","closedAt":"2023-01-31T23:05:29Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-01-25T02:15:07Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":1010,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Missing Heading for \"Async/Manual Activity Completion\" in Go SDK Doc","updatedAt":"2023-01-31T23:05:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1010"}
