This was because if AddDefault is specified, the readyFunc is never executed. By storing the value in channel's recValue beforehand, we are making it available for any future receives on that channel without dropping the signal.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  See: https://github.com/altafDevRev/temporal-samples/pull/1\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w687R-1Pg","author":{"login":"yuandrew"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"SDK flag was reverted in #2070, so this needs to be re-addressed.\n\nWhen re-enabling the flag, must address the issue described in https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2066","createdAt":"2025-11-12T16:50:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1624#issuecomment-3522909152","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-09-06T04:34:11Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":1624,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Signal sent to Selector can be lost if Default path blocks ","updatedAt":"2025-11-12T16:50:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1624"}
