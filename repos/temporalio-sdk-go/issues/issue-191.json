Please describe.**\r\nTemporal SDK is used as a base for various frameworks. Some of those frameworks have need to dynamically load and unload workflow and activity implementations without stopping a Go worker. [Proposed PHP SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/blob/master/php/php-rr-sdk.md) which will be built on top of Go worker is one of such frameworks.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA generic workflow implementation handler that receives the workflow type (or activity type) as an argument.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAnother option is to provide registration API that can be called after worker has started. The drawback of this approach that it is not going to work with dynamic code loading. For example, a workflow task with an unknown workflow type can automatically look up a new implementation in a remote implementation artifact storage by its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2025-08-25T15:15:26Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-07-13T23:39:23Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":191,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add ability to register a single generic workflow and activity implementation for multiple types","updatedAt":"2025-08-25T15:15:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/191"}
