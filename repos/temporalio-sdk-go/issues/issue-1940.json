Create client with remote dataconverter\n  2. Create schedule on the temporal server\n  3. Create handle to the schedule and call Describe on it\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: 1.33.1\n  - Platform: go-sdk\n\n## The error\n\nThe error comes from:\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/converter/codec.go#L361\n```\nif err = protojson.Unmarshal(bs, &payloadspb); err != nil {\n\thttp.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)\n\treturn\n}\n```\nThe `bs` variable which is the body of the request is: `{\"payloads\":[null]}`\n\nOur solution for now is downgrade the client to 1.30.0 before adding the user metadata summary feature.","closedAt":"2025-04-30T00:04:16Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686pOHlD","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks! Yes, we should not be calling the data converter with a null payload. We will fix. Arguably, we should also gracefully use zero value when deserializing from a null payload, but that is a separate concern.","createdAt":"2025-04-29T14:02:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1940#issuecomment-2839050563","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-04-29T11:12:27Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDg2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1940,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Bug: remote dataconverter schedule decsribe","updatedAt":"2025-04-30T00:04:16Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1940"}
