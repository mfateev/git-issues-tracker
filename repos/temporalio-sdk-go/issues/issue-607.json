We intentionally do not make the `converter` package aware of the `workflow` package (causes circular package dependency). Right now we have `workflow.ContextAware` and _technically_ we could have `workflow.EncodingContextAware` or `workflow.PayloadContextAware`, but in order to keep things reasonably separated, I think context awareness of an encoding converter may have to be a sample instead of something in code.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","createdAt":"2021-11-01T19:19:23Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/607#issuecomment-956518217","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w68452aCw","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"After some thought, we have decided to abandon context-awareness for encoding data converters at the moment.","createdAt":"2021-11-16T18:44:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/607#issuecomment-970563760","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-10-28T15:37:28Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":607,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Allow `EncodingDataConverter` to be context aware","updatedAt":"2021-11-16T18:44:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/607"}
