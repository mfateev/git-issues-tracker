Please describe.**\r\nCancellation of a Context passed to a `WorkflowRun.Get(ctx, valuePtr)` cancels the blocking for the return value rather than the `WorkflowRun` itself.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n[Maxim describes the above as intended](https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTDTU3J4T/p1622853305052600?thread_ts=1622851948.052500&cid=CTDTU3J4T).  An additional or different `WorkflowCancelingGet(ctx, valuePtr)` which cancels the workflow allows for the more conventional \"cancel all downstream actions because they are too slow or we already have the result we need\" behavior as present in Golang web apps and other context-aware applications.  In particular I can imagine a context in which the `WorkflowRun` above has spun off a number of parallel activities in goroutines and are blocking on a Select.  If that takes too long the context can be cancelled and all downstream activities can shut down and return `nil` or another appropriate value/error.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis issue was created based on Maxim's request in [this](https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTDTU3J4T/p1622851948052500) thread in the Temporal Slack.","closedAt":"2025-08-25T15:23:09Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686_-E7p","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Currently no plans to change how `WorkflowRun.Get(ctx, valuePtr)` works.
