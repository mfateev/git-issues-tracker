Please describe.**\r\n\r\nSome advanced use cases of workflow data converters do not want to be bound to Temporal workflow deadlock rules\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nFor as much as is reasonable, try to do the data conversion outside of the inline workflow and nearer to the commands/events. Even if I try to take a simple approach (e.g. shipping Go object + data converter around instead of payloads), I fear this is quite a daunting challenge. Also, I will have to confirm we don't expect data conversion errors to be able to be handled inline.","closedAt":"2022-04-13T16:55:28Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685Ak_IV","author":{"login":"mfateev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"One \"hacky\" option is to measure time spent in DataConverter and extend the deadlock detector timeout by this value.","createdAt":"2022-03-30T17:49:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/769#issuecomment-1083437589","viewerDidAuthor":true},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685AlM9g","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, I am thinking this is the most likely approach (or as a timer that can be stopped and then started again)","createdAt":"2022-03-30T18:45:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/769#issuecomment-1083494240","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-03-30T17:17:47Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":769,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Move some data conversion out of the deadlock detection scope","updatedAt":"2022-04-13T16:55:28Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/769"}
