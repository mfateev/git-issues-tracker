Please describe.**\r\nIn some cases, activity and workflow implementations should be loaded dynamically.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nExpose an extension point for dynamic activity loading. This issue is created to ensure feature parity among SDK's where https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/245 already implements this for Java.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn [Dynamic activities registration at runtime and worker splitting](https://community.temporal.io/t/dynamic-activities-registration-at-runtime-and-worker-splitting/930/12?u=aschrijver) on the community forum @mfateev requested another user to create this issue, but that never happened AFAIK.
