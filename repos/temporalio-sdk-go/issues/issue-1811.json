This causes orphaned proto messages (i.e. ones not referenced in that object graph) to be missed. We should change the code generator to walk the file descriptors of the entire proto repo so we know we catch them all.\n\nThis goes along with https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1809.","closedAt":"2025-02-18T17:28:58Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-02-10T20:06:29Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1811,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[api-go] Code gen for payload visiting should walk all descriptors instead of workflow service reachability","updatedAt":"2025-02-18T17:28:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1811"}
