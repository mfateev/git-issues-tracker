Specifically, the removal of \"ById\" of the `*ByIdRequest` and `*ByIdResponse` within [this commit](https://github.com/temporalio/api-go/commit/c83bb3e830970bec60f0a8b89b0d4137b0c6a411) and the file `workflowservice/v1/request_response.go-helpers.pb.go`.\n\n\n## Expected Behavior\nExisting code compiles after upgrading all libraries to the latest versions.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nCompilation failures due to missing symbols, which have been renamed.\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n  1. Use sdk-go v1.32.1 and api-go v1.43.2, in my case I was reading history events.\n  1. Upgrade to api-go@latest (i.e. v1.44.0).\n  1. Code no longer compiles.\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: sdk-go v1.32.1 (latest) + api-go v1.44.0 (latest)\n  - Platform: all\n","closedAt":"2025-08-25T15:11:46Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686diMHN","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I am struggling to replicate this.
