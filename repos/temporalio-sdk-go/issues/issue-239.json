Doc is outdated and @cullywakelin will fix it soon. I removed all duplicate options from `WorkerOptions` and move few of them to `ClientOptions`. Now `WorkerOptions` contain only worker specific options and all the rest goes to `ClientOptions`.\r\nIt seems we don't have example for tracing in our [samples repo](https://github.com/temporalio/go-samples) and there are no integration tests neither (it would be great if you contribute).
