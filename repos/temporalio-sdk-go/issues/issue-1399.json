Please describe.**\r\nAll workflows we use are restartable, workflow versioning is not possible, since there are a lot of changes being deployed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhen `WorkflowPanicPolicy` is set to `ResetWorkflow`, the workflow will restart when a panic occurs.\r\nAn additional option called `ResetReapplyType` same as in the `ResetWorkflowExecutionRequest` (option is used when resetting a workflow)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nSetting `WorkflowPanicPolicy` as `FailWorkflow` and set workflow `RetryPolicy` seems to be working. But there are a few caveats with it:\r\n- Any real errors returning from the workflow to terminate the workflow must be wrapped with `temporal.NewNonRetyableError`\r\n- Reset does not replay the signals (which we want).\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nDiscussion related to this feature request: https://community.temporal.io/t/catching-nondeterministicexception/5020/5\r\n","closedAt":"2024-02-26T22:15:55Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6851JGk6","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@elb3k there is already a SDK feature issue for this https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/417.\r\n","createdAt":"2024-02-26T21:26:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1399#issuecomment-1965320506","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-02-26T20:46:40Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1399,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Reset `WorkflowPanicPolicy` option","updatedAt":"2024-02-26T22:26:42Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1399"}
