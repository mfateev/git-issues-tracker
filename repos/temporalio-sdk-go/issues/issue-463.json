Polling using activity retries works great, but logs get spammed by expected \"errors\".\r\nI was able to hack a workaround by implementing a custom logger and filtering logs with \"Activty Error.\" message and specific error in \"Error\" keyval. However, that's a terrible solution. I would prefer to not rely on internal temporal log, which may change anytime, to handle such issues.\r\n\r\nOne simple solution would be to add a new \"log-level\" field in [ApplicationErrorOptions](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/error.go#L124) which can be checked before executing the [Activity Failed log](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/internal_task_handlers.go#L2223).","createdAt":"2024-07-26T07:47:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/463#issuecomment-2252169235","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686_-FoK","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is now resolved by the new `ApplicationErrorCategory` field ","createdAt":"2025-08-25T15:24:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/463#issuecomment-3220724234","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-06-13T18:18:36Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":463,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Retry Policy Loglevel","updatedAt":"2025-08-25T15:24:05Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/463"}
