Please describe.**\r\n\r\nToday when given a name to register workflows (and activities?) with, we also effectively register the function name _and_ we don't check for uniqueness like we do with the explicit name. So when the workflow is called by function reference, it could still suffer ambiguity.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd `workflow.RegisterOptions.DisableFunctionNameAlias` to disable this default aliasing (and activity too?). We can't make the disable default due to backwards-compatibility reasons.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nWe could just live with it and tell people that are registering with a string name that they have to call by string name too or we won't protect them. But this is a trivial change.","closedAt":"2022-07-14T14:12:34Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6847UXdv","author":{"login":"laniehei"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"maybe related? 🙃  https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/425","createdAt":"2021-12-15T20:37:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/672#issuecomment-995194735","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6847gOM3","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"After discussion, the better handling of this issue is to qualify the alias.
