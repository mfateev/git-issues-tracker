On WFT 2, it changes a boolean flag in the workflow making the code non-deterministic.\n\nWFT1 is triggered by an update-with-start (update ID A) and is responded to by accepting & completing that update. \n\nWFT2 is triggered by an update (update ID B).\n\nHowever, when responding to WFT2, the SDK re-sends acceptance and completion messages for update A, which is incorrect.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-02-20T19:04:40Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDg2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1838,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Non-deterministic workflow code can send incorrect WFT completion without task failure","updatedAt":"2025-02-20T19:04:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1838"}
