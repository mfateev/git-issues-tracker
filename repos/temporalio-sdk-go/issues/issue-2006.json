Please describe.**\nWhen we added dynamic workflows, the `WorkflowReplayer` stopped implementing the `WorkflowRegistry` interface.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd a compiler check to ensure the `WorkflowReplayer` interface implements the `WorkflowRegistry` interface. The main implication of this is that we need to add `RegisterDynamicWorkflow` to the workflow replayer.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nAnother option is removing the two explicit register calls on `WorkflowReplayer` and embedding `WorkflowRegistry` interface there and implementing `RegisterDynamicWorkflow` on the workflow replayer.","closedAt":"2025-07-30T23:15:02Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-25T17:41:30Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2006,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add a compiler check to ensure the WorkflowReplayer interface implements the WorkflowRegistry interface.","updatedAt":"2025-07-30T23:15:02Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2006"}
