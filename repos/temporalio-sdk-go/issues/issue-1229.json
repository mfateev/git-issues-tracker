Please describe.**\r\nWe use a helper function to set up additional logging for our workflows, \r\n```\r\nfunc (w *Workflow) Run(ctx workflow.Context, wfInput *Input) error {\r\n\treturn logger.WorkflowRun(ctx, wfInput, w.Execute)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich uses generics and looks like this\r\n```\r\nfunc WorkflowRun[I any](ctx workflow.Context, input I, runner WorkflowRunner[I]) error {\r\n\tl, onComplete := workflowRunBefore(ctx)\r\n\tdefer onComplete()\r\n\r\n\terr := runner(ctx, l, input)\r\n\r\n\tworkflowRunAfter(l, err)\r\n\r\n\treturn err\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nsince we're using generics the workflow checker doesn't know that the main body of the workflow is actually the `w.Execute` function. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIdeally we could change the entry point to be the `(w *Workflow) Execute` method instead of the `(w *Workflow) Run` method since we don't actually need any of the methods our logging package utilizes checked for determinism. \r\n","closedAt":"2023-09-08T18:09:58Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685mCYAz","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We have made a recent change in #1215 where we now check all functions that accept a `workflow.Context` as their first parameter.
