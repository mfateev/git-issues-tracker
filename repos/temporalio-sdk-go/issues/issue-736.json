Please describe.**\r\n\r\nTrying to test a scenario that uses \"SignalWithStartWorkflow\" available in the client, I've found out there's no equivalent method in the testsuite, neither that function is available to workflows for sending signals to other workflows in standby.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSignalWithStartWorkflow should be included in the testsuite. Ideally I should able to create a standard client for a unit test environment.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nDoing integration tests instead of unit tests.\r\n","closedAt":"2022-03-01T14:40:23Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w684-hF94","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Sending signals is done with `testsuite.TestWorkflowEnvironment.RegisterDelayedCallback`.

You can of course pass params to the workflow and of course pass params to the signal.
