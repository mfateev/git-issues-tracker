And when an activity sends something to it make SignalWorkflow call to the service. \r\nInside the workflow code this signal is pushed to the channel passed to the activity as a parameter.\r\n\r\nThe similar approach should work for child workflows as well.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-04-13T18:14:15Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":101,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Add ability to pass Channel as a parameter to Child workflow and activity","updatedAt":"2020-04-13T18:14:15Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/101"}
