But if the language doesn't have a wrapper for stubs (like Java does), this method may be on WorkflowClient.\r\n\r\nIssues for other SDKs:\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/828\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/issues/312","closedAt":"2022-05-06T14:58:35Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w68456iSE","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Waiting on SDK consensus here.","createdAt":"2021-11-17T14:41:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/595#issuecomment-971646084","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685Aeums","author":{"login":"guptamridul1809"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":" `// checkHealth checks service health using gRPC health check:\r\n// https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/health-checking.md\r\nfunc checkHealth(connection grpc.ClientConnInterface, options ConnectionOptions) error {`\r\n\r\nThere is **checkHealth** method which is invoked at the time of client creation, but it is private (go.temporal.io/sdk@v1.12.0/internal/client.go)\r\nIt would be great if we can expose this method to public interface\r\nwill be helpful in observability and auto-recovery use-cases","createdAt":"2022-03-29T12:15:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/595#issuecomment-1081797036","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685AfU6y","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@guptamridul1809 - This is no longer invoked on client creation in the current version (we invoke another call).
