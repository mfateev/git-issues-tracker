The test passes when using Go SDK v.1.19.0 and I expected that it would continue to pass after I upgraded to Go SDK v1.22.1.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using Go SDK v1.22.1, the test fails with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      Error:   Received unexpected error:\r\n                  unknown field \"workerVersioningId\" in history.WorkflowTaskCompletedEventAttributes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is likely occurring because several of the Events in the JSON file have a `workerVersioningId` attribute and all of those have a `null` value. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    {\r\n      \"eventId\": \"120\",\r\n      \"eventTime\": \"2023-02-23T22:36:23.449411426Z\",\r\n      \"eventType\": \"WorkflowTaskCompleted\",\r\n      \"version\": \"0\",\r\n      \"taskId\": \"1048893\",\r\n      \"workerMayIgnore\": false,\r\n      \"workflowTaskCompletedEventAttributes\": {\r\n        \"scheduledEventId\": \"118\",\r\n        \"startedEventId\": \"119\",\r\n        \"identity\": \"89088@twwmbp@\",\r\n        \"binaryChecksum\": \"c71778aac6cf45bd5e0f83254734a73a\",\r\n        \"workerVersioningId\": null\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the ideal solution is probably to ensure that the Web UI does not include null attributes like these, the fact that there's a version in production that includes them means that the SDK probably needs to handle them (i.e., by ignoring them instead of returning the error).\r\n\r\nNOTE: I downloaded the JSON file from the Temporal Web UI. It was _likely_ version 2.10.3, but since I downloaded that file several weeks ago, I can't be 100% sure about which version I was running at the time. Also note that this may be the same problem originally reported in [#1084](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1084), but there's not enough detail in that issue for me to be sure of that.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\nI have created a git repo with an example you can use to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n  1. `git clone git@github.com:tomwheeler/workflow-replayer-bug-reproduction.git`\r\n  1. `cd workflow-replayer-bug-reproduction/example`\r\n  1. `go test`\r\n\r\nYou should observe the failure. You can then checkout the `sdk-v1.19.0`, run `go mod tidy`, and repeat the steps to observe that the test passes when using the older Go SDK (v1.19.0 instead of v.1.22.1).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: Go SDK 1.22.1\r\n  - Platform: macOS\r\n","closedAt":"2023-04-19T19:56:36Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-04-19T16:36:54Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":1091,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Replaying Workflow History Yields Unexpected Error Due to Unknown Field \"workerVersioningId\"","updatedAt":"2023-04-19T19:56:36Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1091"}
