Please describe.**\r\nI am trying to write a workflow test that would call `workflow.UpsertSearchAttributes` possibly many times. The order of the calls is slightly random (randomization inside a side effect for deterministic replay), so I was hoping to use the `OnUpsertSearchAttributes` hook of the `TestWorkflowEnvironment` to record the calls that were made and check myself to ensure they are within the expected randomization bounds.\r\n\r\nHowever, it appears that `OnUpsertSearchAttributes` takes a single argument of type `map[string]interface{}`, unlike `OnActivity` whose arguments are just `interface{}`. As far as I can tell, this prevents me from passing something equivalent to `mock.Anything` and using the `.Run()` function on the mock to record the actual arguments that were passed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like a way to use `OnUpsertSearchAttributes` or some other similar hook more like `OnActivity`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWe tried using the actual key(s) that would be in the upsert payload with `mock.Anything` as the value; we also tried using `mock.Anything` as the key, but neither allowed for arbitrary matching.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2022-07-01T12:29:16Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685DXOCm","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Hrmm, I wonder if just changing that param from `map[string]interface{}` to just `interface{}` introduces any big problematic backwards compatibility concerns.
