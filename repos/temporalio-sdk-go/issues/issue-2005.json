You can see `Test_ChildWorkflowContextPropagation` passes as expected, which confirms the header passing is working and the child workflow can see it\n  4. But `Test_ChildWorkflowContextPropagation_Matcher` fails, which means the headers are not viewable via the OnWorkflow mocker\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: v1.24.0\n  - Platform:\n  ```\nuname -a\nDarwin Xinyis-Laptop.local 24.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.5.0: Tue Apr 22 19:54:49 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.121.6~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000 arm64\n```","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-20T00:00:18Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDg2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":2005,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"OnWorkflow test mocker doesn't propagate context headers","updatedAt":"2025-07-20T00:00:18Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2005"}
