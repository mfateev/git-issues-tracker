Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, the `ExecuteWorkflow` mocker can only support return based on the static argument\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tmockClient.On(\"ExecuteWorkflow\", mock.Anything, mock.AnythingOfType(\"internal.StartWorkflowOptions\"), mock.Anything,\r\n\t\t&datamodel.NewCustomerMetadata{\r\n\t\t\tCustomerID:       \"good\",\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t).Return(mockWorkflowRun, nil).Maybe()\r\n\r\n\tmockClient.On(\"ExecuteWorkflow\", mock.Anything, mock.AnythingOfType(\"internal.StartWorkflowOptions\"), mock.Anything,\r\n\t\t&datamodel.NewCustomerMetadata{\r\n\t\t\tCustomerID:       \"bad\",\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t).Return(nil, fmt.Errorf(\"error\")).Maybe()\r\n```\r\nWith latest mocker, we could do\r\n```\r\n\tmockClient.On(\"ExecuteWorkflow\", mock.Anything, mock.AnythingOfType(\"internal.StartWorkflowOptions\"), mock.AnythingOfType(\"string\"), mock.Anything).Return(\r\n\t\tfunc(ctx context.Context, options client.StartWorkflowOptions, workflow string, newCustomerMetadata *datamodel.NewCustomerMetadata) (client.WorkflowRun, error) {\r\n\t\t\tif newCustomerMetadata.CustomerID == \"bad\" {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn nil, fmt.Errorf(\"error\")\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\treturn nil, nil\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t).Maybe()\r\n```\r\nThis is becoming very useful if one argument in `newCustomerMetadata` is `timestamp` with the usage `time.Now()`. With existing mocker, it's difficult to do the mocking as testify would find out the argument match by value\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nPlease rerun latest mockery\r\nExample\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1353\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","closedAt":"2024-01-17T22:20:25Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685xE6vO","author":{"login":"yinsidij"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"this will be solved by PRs\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1353\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1361","createdAt":"2024-01-17T22:20:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1354#issuecomment-1897114574","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-01-15T08:15:06Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1354,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Please help regenerate mocks","updatedAt":"2024-01-17T22:20:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1354"}
