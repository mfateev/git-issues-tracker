Please describe.** / **Describe the solution you'd like**\n`DescribeTaskQueueEnhanced` has inputs and outputs that use a bunch of deprecated gRPC fields that only have to do with v2 versioning. It should be deprecated.\n\n`DescribeTaskQueue` does not currently follow the pattern of using a struct as the input, making it a bit complicated to change the input parameters. There are two flags that we need to be able to pass:\n- ReportStats -> for showing backlog stats\n- ReportConfig -> for showing Priority and Fairness config\n\nThe output of `DescribeTaskQueue` is already just the raw gRPC object, so it already has the VersionInfo we need, it just doesn't have backlog.\nIf whoever takes this ticket changes that output format, please make sure to expose the Task Queue's VersioningInfo in the response.\n\n","closedAt":"2026-01-21T22:32:03Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w687hZFlp","author":{"login":"carlydf"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/726","createdAt":"2026-01-21T22:32:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2162#issuecomment-3781450089","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2026-01-21T21:58:11Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2162,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Versioning + Priority and Fairness: Expose TaskQueueStats and TaskQueueConfig in DescribeTaskQueue, likely deprecate DescribeTaskQueueEnhanced","updatedAt":"2026-01-21T22:32:03Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2162"}
