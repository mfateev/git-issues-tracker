Please describe.**\r\nRequest: return an error when an activity is called with the wrong number of parameters\r\n\r\nI spent awhile debugging an issue where I was calling an activity with the wrong number of parameters.\r\n\r\nMy code was:\r\n`workflow.ExecuteActivity(activityCtx, UpdateLoadDetailsActivity, wfstate.EntityID, *params.DetailsParams)`\r\n\r\nIt should have been:\r\n`workflow.ExecuteActivity(activityCtx, UpdateLoadDetailsActivity, *params.DetailsParams)`\r\n\r\nI get this error:\r\n```\r\nActivity error.\t{\"Namespace\": \"default\", \"TaskQueue\": \"MEDIUM_PRI\", \"WorkerID\": \"8693@Patricks-MacBook-Pro.local@\", \"WorkflowID\": \"lifecycle:302-85005442966618114\", \"RunID\": \"b908c11f-f4a0-4ffd-a991-28cc9fd7e9cf\", \"ActivityType\": \"UpdateLoadDetailsActivity\", \"Attempt\": 1, \"Error\": \"unable to decode the activity function input payload with error: payload item 0: unable to decode: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type store.UpdateLoadDetailsParams for function name: UpdateLoadDetailsActivity\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error is fine and obvious in retrospect - I passed an `EntityID` (alias for `string`) in a param that should have been a struct `UpdateLoadDetailsParams`. However, it took me awhile to see this as I was indeed passing a param of the correct type, it was just in the wrong order since I had the wrong number of params in my call.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe request here is to return a more obvious error in this case - an error that the length of params is wrong. Note that this will be less forgiving than current behavior in the case when you call an activity with too many params and the types of the accepted params match - currently no error is thrown, the extra params are just ignored.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nleave as-is\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n-","closedAt":"2021-11-18T15:01:09Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6845OzeV","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"To clarify, is the suggestion that instead of reporting the first item (i.e. \"item 0\") is the wrong type, first do a param count check and report parameter count mismatch before trying to decode each one?","createdAt":"2021-11-03T21:59:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/617#issuecomment-960182165","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6845O0Cy","author":{"login":"finnigantime"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Yes, that's exactly correct.","createdAt":"2021-11-03T22:00:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/617#issuecomment-960184498","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w684519ys","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@finnigantime - After digging, I have determined that we don't actually require that you have the exact parameter count.
