The usage message claims that `-V` will print the version and exit, so I ran this, expecting to see the version number reported.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nI got an error `workflowcheck: unsupported flag value: -V=true`\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Run `workflowcheck -h` to see the usage message\r\n  2. Observe that the first flag described (`-V`) purports to show the version\r\n  3. Run `workflowcheck -V`\r\n  4. Observe that you see the error listed above instead of the expected version number\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: Unclear (I could reproduce this with an older version installed a few months ago and the current version installed a few minutes ago)\r\n  - Platform: Mac OS 12.6.3 running on a M1 Mac CPU\r\n","closedAt":"2023-06-27T20:58:42Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685X_ORF","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is a Go bug: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57716.
