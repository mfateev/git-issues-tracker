Please describe.**\r\n\r\nProblem best described in #586, but basically the incorrect `OnActivity((*myStruct).MyFunc)` in Go makes the receiver the first arg, whereas `OnActivity(new(myStruct).MyFunc)` has a receiver instance and therefore works as expected.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nTry to determine that it's a function of a method and that the receiver is the first param (i.e. param count is actual param count + 1), then remove the receiver. It is possible Go may not make this easy enough to determine reflectively and this issue may not work (sure you can check the runtime function pointer name for `-fm`, but is that enough to get the type reflectively?).\r\n\r\nAt the very least, document the behavior.\r\n","closedAt":"2022-01-07T17:40:06Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6848DTtt","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"After investigation, I have confirmed we cannot really do anything here at runtime because we also don't support registration of activities this way (i.e. `RegisterActivity((*myStruct).MyFunc)` would not work right either).
