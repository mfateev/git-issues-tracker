Please describe.**\r\nFor a long running workflows that is restarted periodically using `NewContinueAsNewError`, the existing retry policy is propagated to the new workflow. This behavior is fine until we need to adjust the retry policy. Without such an option, the workflow needs to be re-submitted using `StartWorkflowOptions`.\r\n\r\nNote that this option is already available in `sdk-java`: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/72ebff1dcb2c14b3aecc7de14a2b9aa21ef9cc4a/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/workflow/ContinueAsNewOptions.java#L95\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSimilar to `WithWorkflowRunTimeout`, provide an option to override the retry policy.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2024-02-14T22:18:35Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-09T06:02:51Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1384,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add an option to override retry policy","updatedAt":"2024-02-14T22:18:35Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1384"}
