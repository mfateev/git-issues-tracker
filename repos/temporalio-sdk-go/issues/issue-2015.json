Please describe.**\nThere is a deprecated `control` field still used in Go in a few spots. One spot: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/eca0bb454260f34ca6b873b73c7353dafb4f7ebb/internal/internal_event_handlers.go#L1275\n\nThis needs to be removed since it may be yeeted from server at some point in the future (and no other SDKs use it)\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nSeemingly, this is just being set to event number. Just use event number instead, and cover it with some tests.","closedAt":"2025-08-25T15:41:06Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-08-06T21:48:07Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2015,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Remove usage of deprecated `Control` fields","updatedAt":"2025-08-25T15:41:06Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2015"}
