There may be more spots\n\nYes, it appears #1416 didn't apply the timeout to all places get system info is called. We do need to fix this, thanks!\n\n> The reason i was poking out here is because i get timeouts a lot when talking to local temporal dev server when the dev server is definitely up. If anyone knows what causes that some advice would be appreciated\n\nThis could be for any number of reasons. Many use the dev server a lot and it should always connect basically immediately and definitely not hit any timeouts (default or manually set). There may be something unique to your setup.
