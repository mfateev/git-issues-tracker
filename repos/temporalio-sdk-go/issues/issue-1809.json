Please describe.**\nThe proxy should visit all payloads even if they are not reachable by the workflow service\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n Add a test that somehow makes sure every payload is visited even if it's not reachable from workflow service.\n\nAn ideal approach would be to confirm payload encoding in all the existing integration tests rather than trying to build a contrived one. The key is we use a different way of discovering/walking payloads vs. what is used to walk them on encoding.\n\n**Additional context**\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/api-go/pull/209","closedAt":"2025-03-18T20:15:12Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686i_shk","author":{"login":"yuandrew"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"completed in https://github.com/temporalio/api-go/pull/211","createdAt":"2025-03-18T20:15:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1809#issuecomment-2734606436","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-02-10T15:19:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1809,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[api-go] Add test for proxy to make sure all payloads are visited even if it's not reachable","updatedAt":"2025-03-18T20:15:13Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1809"}
