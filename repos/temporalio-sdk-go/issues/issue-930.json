Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIn #924 we added support to optionally move message and stack trace into encoded attributes. We need to support this for proxies too.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nProbably best to alter https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/internal/cmd/generateinterceptor/main.go to add `EncodeCommonAttributes bool` to `PayloadCodecGRPCClientInterceptorOptions` and, if `true`, move the message and stack trace to the encoded attributes pre-encode (and back out post-decode). This will allow proxies using this interceptor to support encoded failure attributes transparently via the interceptor in the way that's understandable in the UI.","closedAt":"2023-01-11T15:47:03Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685SMcTM","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This was done as `converter.NewFailureGRPCClientInterceptor` in #974 ","createdAt":"2023-01-11T15:47:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/930#issuecomment-1378993356","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-10-11T14:57:56Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":930,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support failure encoding in proxy gRPC interceptor","updatedAt":"2023-01-11T15:47:03Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/930"}
