Please describe.**\r\nI would like to test my workflow when it has a populated `workflow.GetInfo(ctx).ContinuedExecutionRunID`.  Currently, one cannot do that so not all workflow paths may be unit tested.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIdeally, I would like a way to set a workflow's context during its unit test execution.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nOne could do something elaborate for testing purposes.  Maybe have a variable or a dependency injection so the unit test can pretend to see a value for `ContinuedExecutionRunID`.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://community.temporal.io/t/testing-continueasnew/6211/6","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685MOtGf","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Hrmm, there are several other things on workflow info one might want to set as well. _Technically_ the workflow info is mutable in the test suite so we could expose the mutable pointer via `TestWorkflowEnvironment.WorkflowInfo()` or similar.
