Please describe.**\r\nFor projects that have a large number of workflows, especially for CRUD-like functions across multiple topics, name collisions start to happen quickly. To work around this, we scope functions in go packages, such as `mypackage1.Create` and `mypackage2.Create`, but when we call `RegisterWorkflow`, the [internal code](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/ca9a4c12b25cc23546b9876b4a86acaf024df81c/internal/internal_worker.go#L495) only uses the function name with none of the package name pieces included, and those the two are both stored as `Create` and the SDK panics with `workflow name \"Create\" is already registered`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be really nice if we could register structs that contain exported workflow functions, in the same manner that we can currently register a collection of activities via a struct pointer.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWhile I know we can use aliases, doing so complicates executing workflows.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2021-01-12T21:51:42Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NjMwODk3MQ==","author":{"login":"shaunco"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I went down the alias path.
