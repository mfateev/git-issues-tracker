This causes scheduled activities to forever hand in `PENDING_ACTIVITY_STATE_SCHEDULED` state.\n\nI suspect because the SlotSupplier interface method ReleaseSlot is not implemented:\n\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/master/contrib/resourcetuner/resourcetuner.go#L204\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n  1. Create a tuner with `worker.NewCompositeTuner` and `resourcetuner.NewResourceBasedSlotSupplier` as suggested in [go-sdk docs](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/worker-performance#go-sdk)\n  1. Set activity `ResourceBasedSlotSupplierOptions.MaxSlots` to something small like 4.\n  1. Start a worker with tuner set in worker.Options\n  1. Execute a workflow that starts a large amount of activities - few activities should be scheduled, and others should be schedule/stuck in pending state.\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version:\n  ```\n        go.temporal.io/api v1.44.1\n\tgo.temporal.io/sdk v1.33.0\n\tgo.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/resourcetuner v0.0.0-20250227195219-884681f7392e\n```\n  - Platform: GCP Cloud Run, 8 cores 8GiB per instance, unsure chip used (i think amd based)\n","closedAt":"2025-03-14T18:57:27Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-03-13T02:53:25Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDg2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1868,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"ResourceBasedSlotSupplier.ReleaseSlot not implemented","updatedAt":"2025-03-14T18:57:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1868"}
