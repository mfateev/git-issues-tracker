I would expect logs within a tracing scope to be logged to their respective spans. \r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nThe logs are not propagated to the Spans. \r\n\r\nWithin the `tracingWorkflowOutboundInterceptor` (vendor/go.temporal.io/sdk/interceptor/tracing_interceptor.go:490) a call is made to `BaseTracer.GetLogger(log.logger, TracerSpanRef)`. The TracerSpanRef is ignored and the tracing information is lost.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Create an empty workflow\r\n  1. Retrieve the logger via `workflow.GetLogger(ctx)`\r\n  1. Log a line of information\r\n  2. check the output (in this case via the docker image jaeger-all-in-one:latest)\r\n  3. Inspect a trace\r\n  4. Inspect the workflow Span\r\n  5. Check the logs related to the Span\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6585005/167386243-d84bc2cc-b2a4-4c8e-acc9-8140adfbe8d5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: \r\n    - go.temporal.io/sdk v1.14.0\r\n    - go.temporal.io/sdk/contrib/opentelemetry v0.1.0\r\n    - go.opentelemetry.io/otel v1.6.1\r\n    - go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/jaeger v1.6.1\r\n    - go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk v1.6.1\r\n    \r\n  - Platform:\r\n    - macOS 12.3, Ubuntu 18.04 \r\n","closedAt":"2022-05-17T09:09:36Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685DOM3N","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The default implementation of `GetLogger` intentionally does not apply logs to the trace. The `GetLogger` method was added by DataDog at #655 since they want to implement their own `interceptor.Tracer` that overrides that and _does_ provide a tracing enabled logger. By default we don't want all user logs to appear in traces. But if this is important for you, you can implement your own tracer, probably wrapping/delegating to the ones that exist, but providing your own `GetLogger` impl that does attach logs to traces.","createdAt":"2022-05-16T15:10:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/802#issuecomment-1127796173","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685DRVai","author":{"login":"pimvanhespen"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi @cretz, thank you very much for your explanation!
