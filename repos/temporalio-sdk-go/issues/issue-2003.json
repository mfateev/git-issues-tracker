Please describe.**\nWhen deploying a new version of a service, some activities are aborted causing increased errors and latency. Even though the activities are meant to be retried, it seems wasteful to force them to do it instead of waiting a few seconds before shutting down the old compute instances.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWe would like to [set up `shutdownGraceTime` just like in the Typescript SDK](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/worker.WorkerOptions#shutdowngracetime) to something like 10 seconds.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nThe only alternative we see is to avoid using Temporal in latency-sensitive workflows, which is not something we would like to do, but seems to be the only option currently. After all, we would like to make multiple deployments a day without noticeably increasing latency of the running workflows.","closedAt":"2025-07-16T19:59:06Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6863lXT1","author":{"login":"yuandrew"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I believe what you're looking for is `WorkerStopTimeout`.
