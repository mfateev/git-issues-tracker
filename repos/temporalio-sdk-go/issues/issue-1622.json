So for example an `update.Request` from `workflowservice.PollWorkflowTaskQueueResponse` may not be visited because `messages` is a `protocol.Message` with an `Any` containing that request.\r\n\r\nMake sure to support `Any` in addition to payload.","closedAt":"2024-09-05T20:50:15Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-09-05T12:37:35Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":1622,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"API Go's payload visitor not visiting `Any` for payloads inside","updatedAt":"2024-09-05T20:50:15Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1622"}
