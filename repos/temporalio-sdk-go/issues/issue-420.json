Please describe.**\r\nI'm seeing **history size exceeds error limit** error. We have DSL on top of Temporal, so I'm not able to decided when to continue workflow as new. If user define DSL with some big for loop, it will cause **history size exceeds error limit** error. \r\n\r\n**example error message**\r\n```\r\n\"msg\": \"history size exceeds error limit.\",\r\n\"wf-history-size\": 14013736,\r\n\"wf-event-count\": 51201,\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIs it possible to return history size information trough workflow.GetInfo(ctx)? In this way, I'm able to check **wf-history-size** and **wf-event-count** in workflow to decide continue as new or not.\r\n","closedAt":"2023-10-16T17:47:46Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTYxMTU1OQ==","author":{"login":"vitarb"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think this is a valid feature request, I'll discuss with the team if we have good way to expose this information.","createdAt":"2021-06-07T06:07:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/420#issuecomment-855611559","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685pM2n_","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Workflow info now includes history size and length","createdAt":"2023-10-16T17:47:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/420#issuecomment-1764977151","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-04-29T02:01:32Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":420,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Get history size information in workflow","updatedAt":"2023-10-16T17:47:52Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/420"}
