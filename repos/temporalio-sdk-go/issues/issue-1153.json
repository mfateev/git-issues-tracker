I am expecting to pass args of any type of my choice, like it used to be in traditional workflow execution methods.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nI am using the **ScheduleWorkflowAction** type to pass in the values to the Action field, where the **Args** field in ScheduleWorkflowAction is expecting []interface{}. I would like to know if it is intended to be this way, if it is then I would like to know if I should convert all my defined types to []interface and then pass it through.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\nHere is an Example payload that i have used\r\n`client.ScheduleOptions{\r\n\t\tSpec: client.ScheduleSpec{\r\n\t\t\tCronExpressions: []string{\"* * * * *\"},\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tAction: &client.ScheduleWorkflowAction{\r\n\t\t\tWorkflow:    SampleWorkflow,\r\n\t\t\tTaskQueue:   \"\",\r\n\t\t\tArgs:        workflowArgs,\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t}`\r\n\r\nI am expecting **workflowArgs** to be of any type that I define rather than to convert it into []interface{} everytime I decide to pass arguments.\r\n\r\n**MethodUsed** - `ScheduleClient.Create()`\r\n\r\n## Reference Links\r\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/internal#ScheduleWorkflowAction\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: v1.23.1\r\n  - Platform: GoSDK\r\n","closedAt":"2023-07-05T13:20:36Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685gn-Q-","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Yes it is expected.
