Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now, a non-retryable worker error signals itself to kill the process which is not OK.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe need to just stop the entire worker and relay the error. Right now, someone can `Start` and won't see an error until `Stop` is called. We can relay via the `Run` call, but not everyone uses that. We should either return something that the user can listen for errors on from `Start` or we need to have a `WorkerFailureHandler` option or similar (whether that defaults to signal + process death to keep compat is an open question).","closedAt":"2022-05-06T13:16:46Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685CQH5m","author":{"login":"alexshtin"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Code reference: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/cb9c7de44f8774ab6681f4469ecbed8243d082dd/internal/internal_worker_base.go#L320","createdAt":"2022-04-27T21:57:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/792#issuecomment-1111522918","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-04-27T19:07:18Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":792,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Expose fatal worker error in some way and stop killing process","updatedAt":"2022-05-06T13:16:46Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/792"}
