In particular, I think the reuse doesn't clarify that this only applies to previously closed workflows: https://community.temporal.io/t/workflow-id-policy-suggestion/1021/2?u=shannon_tan\r\n\r\n```\r\n// WorkflowIDReusePolicy - Whether server allow reuse of workflow ID, can be useful\r\n// for dedupe logic if set to RejectDuplicate.\r\n// Optional: defaulted to AllowDuplicate.\r\nWorkflowIDReusePolicy enumspb.WorkflowIdReusePolicy\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also makes it a bit confusing when tying it into this following parameter. Is the following line saying that if a workflow had already failed with this ID, and we have this parameter set to false, it'll always return an error? I think what's confusing is that if the WorkflowIDReusePolicy only applies to completed/failed workflows only, I'm not sure how we'd have a \"current\" or last run.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// When WorkflowExecutionErrorWhenAlreadyStarted is true, Client.ExecuteWorkflow will return an error if the\r\n// workflow id has already been used and WorkflowIDReusePolicy would disallow a re-run. If it is set to false,\r\n// rather than erroring a WorkflowRun instance representing the current or last run will be returned.\r\n//\r\n// Optional: defaults to false\r\nWorkflowExecutionErrorWhenAlreadyStarted bool\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps it'd be rephrased as:\r\n```\r\n// When WorkflowExecutionErrorWhenAlreadyStarted is true, client.ExecuteWorkflow will return an error if\r\n// a workflow is already in progress with that ID. If false, rather than erroring, a WorkflowRun instance \r\n// representing the current or last run will be returned. \r\n// Note that workflow IDs must still conform to WorkflowIDReusePolicy regardless of this setting.\r\n```","closedAt":"2025-08-25T15:29:10Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w686_-KGx","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This documentation was updated a while ago","createdAt":"2025-08-25T15:29:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/416#issuecomment-3220742577","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-04-28T00:26:20Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDUzODEzNTY0","name":"potential-bug","description":"","color":"90c109"}],"milestone":null,"number":416,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Confusing Docs Around Reuse Policy","updatedAt":"2025-08-25T15:29:10Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/416"}
