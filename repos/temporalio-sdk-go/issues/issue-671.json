You can set gRPC dial options directly on `client.Options.ConnectionOptions.DialOptions` which could have an interceptor where you can set the header via gRPC metadata. This is basically how the first way is implemented.","createdAt":"2021-12-14T17:14:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/671#issuecomment-993798514","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6848h5hh","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Sample PR merged","createdAt":"2022-01-18T15:23:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/671#issuecomment-1015519329","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685Cuszz","author":{"login":"AbhayP-22"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Do we have the sample to add token in go lang SDK","createdAt":"2022-05-06T11:56:22Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/671#issuecomment-1119538419","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685Cu9Jc","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The sample at https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/tree/main/serverjwtauth shows how to make a custom header provider at https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go/blob/b49280daa78f354036d7d749157252369bca9b89/serverjwtauth/keyutil.go#L135 to set headers with a token.","createdAt":"2022-05-06T13:14:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/671#issuecomment-1119605340","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-12-14T06:40:19Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":671,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"How to provide an Authorization Token in Golang","updatedAt":"2022-05-06T13:14:54Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/671"}
