Please describe.**\r\nIf `WORKFLOW_ID_REUSE_POLICY_REJECT_DUPLICATE` is set the `ExecuteWorkflow `call returns result of already existing workflow instead of the `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted` error. This behavior is the best one for the cases when the deduping of ExecuteWorkflow calls is needed. But in some cases, the client needs to know if it is a duplicated call.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd `StartWorkflowOptions.FailOnAlreadyStareted` option that would force returning `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStarted` in this case.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nDo not return the result of the previous workflow invocation. But it would be a backward incompatible change.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2020-12-23T21:59:17Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDQ4OTMwNQ==","author":{"login":"Sushisource"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Dupe of https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/220","createdAt":"2020-12-23T21:59:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/268#issuecomment-750489305","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-10-13T15:57:55Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":268,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add ability to reject ExecuteWorkflow call on duplicated workflow","updatedAt":"2020-12-23T21:59:17Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/268"}
