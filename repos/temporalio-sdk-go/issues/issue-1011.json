In fact, it doesn't replay the workflow, it just returns without error.\r\nThis is problematic because we use the replayer to do a compatibility check on running workflows. Because of this, if there is a de-serialization problem we can't really test compatibility, as the replayer always returns nil.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Define any workflow\r\n  2. Replay the workflow with a history that can't be de-serialized by the workflow (example: use a different format than what the workflow expects)\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: v1.17.0\r\n  - Platform: go\r\n","closedAt":"2023-02-01T10:27:59Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w685TrH8W","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Can you confirm this issue still exists on the latest SDK?
