Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, To get the result of a workflow, we can call WorkflowRun.Get(), but this is a blocking call that does a long poll for the workflow to finish. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt will be useful to add a flag in this method (or define a new method) that does not do long poll and instead returns immediately if the workflow is still running.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative is to use a lower timeout to the Get call, but that might be a problem if network is slower. \r\n\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2021-11-18T15:05:10Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN1w6845GRwT","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"As another alternative, you can call `Client.DescribeWorkflowExecution` until the status is no longer running then call `Get`.
