Please describe.**\nWe have our own logger structure across all the services that has important features implemented through its methods.\nTemporal logger injects some fields using `With` before execution of activity. \nAnother example is trace interceptor that also uses `With` to put trace/span ids as fields (key values). \nThe problem is that in some cases I receive not my Adapter structure, but \"ReplayLogger\". I can't extract original structure from ReplayLogger (it's private).\n\\+ If other implementations/wrappers appear -- it will imposible to support.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI want to have opportunity to get the original logger structure without losing all the fields injected previously.\nSo the solution can be EITHER, giving a method for getting my configured logger, passed at the configuration step, OR don't wrap the original logger anyhow during the execution (logger always keeps the same type, no decorators allowed). \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nUsing global logger in case I couldn't assert type to my adapter. In this case I can lose important fields or must duplicate them myself from the activity. It's more complicated and expensive to do.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nHow I try to get the original logger from the activity's context:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa9e73fb-5ce5-4261-9679-45c5c63f3151)\n\n`GetLogger` method represents \"global\" clean logger\n\nDifference in execution:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42d870ab-de36-427f-b264-3474f0f53e10)\n\n\nP.S: I'd gladly consider other solutions if you have such. The main goal is to be able to re-use SDK logger enhancements + to continue using project's standard implementation","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-11T11:33:17Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzA3NDky","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1954,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Ability to get original Logger from activity.GetLogger(ctx) / workflow.GetLogger(ctx)","updatedAt":"2025-05-11T11:39:36Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1954"}
