Today, headers are not passed through the codec by default here like they are in .NET and Ruby and such. We should provide an opt-in somewhere to allow this.\n\nUsers using activities and such can just use the data converter w/ the codec, but inside workflows they can't easily, only the payload converter. Ideally all non-search-attributes go through codec, but we can't blindly flip this on.\n\nAsks:\n\n* Opt-in for all non-search-attribute payloads to go through codec (may need to be configured at client level)\n  * Will have to update client and `temporalio.bridge.worker.py`'s `decode_activation` and `encode_completion`\n    * Bonus points if a payload visitor utility is created that does this and can also be used for other purposes, ref https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/468\n* Confirmation via tests that all payloads go through the codec including activation/completion","closedAt":"2025-07-08T18:42:13Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c60S3FT","author":{"login":"Sushisource"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Let’s consider potentially making this opt-out rather than opt-in by default (even though that’s a breaking change) so SDKs are consistent.","createdAt":"2025-07-01T16:59:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/925#issuecomment-3024843091","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-06-26T21:30:41Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":925,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Opt-in support for applying codec to headers","updatedAt":"2025-07-08T18:42:13Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/925"}
