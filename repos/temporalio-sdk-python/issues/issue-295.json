IRL there would be nested dependencies injected\r\n        self.customer_partition = customer_partition\r\n        self.redis_client = redis.Redis()\r\n\r\n    def get_data(self):\r\n        # Access data from the specified customer partition in Redis\r\n        data = self.redis_client.get(self.customer_partition)\r\n        return data\r\n```\r\n and then you have a workflow and an activity that needs this dependency:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Define the Workflow interface\r\nclass CustomerWorkflow:\r\n    @workflow_method(task_queue=\"customer-data\")\r\n    def get_customer_data(self) -> str:\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n# Implement the Workflow\r\nclass CustomerWorkflowImpl(CustomerWorkflow):\r\n    def __init__(self, customer_data_access: CustomerDataAccess):\r\n        self.data_access = customer_data_access\r\n\r\n    def get_customer_data(self) -> str:\r\n        # Access data from a specific customer partition using the Activity\r\n        data = self.data_access.get_data(\"customer1\")\r\n        # do business logic on this data\r\n        return result\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nProposed solution: Add support for pinject, similar to how you folks added support for Spring Boot in Java: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/745\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n","closedAt":"2023-03-10T13:53:53Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5XQFxq","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as question/duplicate.
