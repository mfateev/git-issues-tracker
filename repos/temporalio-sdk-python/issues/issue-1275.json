It was originally chosen because of how well it handled `@overload`s. But it doesn't really get updated much and is a bit buggy, e.g. https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.worker.WorkerDeploymentConfig.html is showing those as class variables (because it doesn't understand data classes) and is even missing `default_versioning_behavior` that is in source with a default.\n\nOpen to all options, but I think we want pure API docs generator, not like Sphinx where English docs come along with, but it's worth a try so long as python.temporal.io is pure API docs. Maybe also try https://pdoc.dev/. Or just check around the ecosystem.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2026-01-14T18:44:49Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1275,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Look into alternative API doc generators","updatedAt":"2026-01-14T18:44:49Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1275"}
