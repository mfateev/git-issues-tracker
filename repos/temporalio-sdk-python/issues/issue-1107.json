Please describe.\n\nCurrently, the dependency specification for protobuf is pinned as protobuf>=3.20,<6. This upper bound prevents usage of the latest protobuf versions (6.x and above), which may block compatibility with other libraries or tools that already depend on newer releases.\nProtobuf 5x will reach End of Support in Q1 2026 so it's better to upgrade asap https://protobuf.dev/support/version-support/#python\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nUpdate the dependency constraint to allow any version of protobuf starting from 3.20 without restricting the upper bound, e.g.:\n\n```text\nprotobuf>=3.20\n```\n\nThis will provide flexibility to use the latest protobuf releases while maintaining compatibility with versions from 3.20 onwards.\n\n### Additional context\nRemoving the <6 upper bound will help ensure this project stays compatible with evolving protobuf releases and reduces dependency conflicts in downstream projects.\nhttps://protobuf.dev/support/version-support/#python Protobuf 5.x will reach End of Support in Q1 2026.
