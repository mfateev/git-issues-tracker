If the Temporal SDK relies on an older version, the build binaries job fails as it is unable to find a suitable version of nexus-rpc.\n\nExample sequence of events:\n* nexus-rpc versions: 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 1.3.0\n* Temporal depends on `nexus-rpc==1.2.0`\n* build-binaries action installs `nexus-rpc==1.3.0`\n* Test wheel step fails b/c the dependency mismatch\n\n","closedAt":"2025-12-10T22:25:46Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-12-09T00:39:31Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1244,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Build Binaries Github Actions Workflow Fails on nexus-rpc mismatch","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T22:25:46Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1244"}
