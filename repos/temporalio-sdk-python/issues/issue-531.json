We should try to include this. If we can do an individual task stack trace that would be great but maybe not possible. If possible, have the stack trace replace the existing deadlock stack trace but this may not be possible if it's lots of coroutine stack traces instead of one.","closedAt":"2024-08-27T21:35:32Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-22T20:08:35Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":531,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Include stack trace on deadlock detection exception","updatedAt":"2024-08-27T21:35:32Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/531"}
