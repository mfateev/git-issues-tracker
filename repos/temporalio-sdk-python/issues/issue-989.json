Please describe.\n\nI need to spawn a number of child workflows and abandon them. Later, the same parent workflow may have a new run and attempt to spawn more child workflows. I'd like to be able to check if any of the new children are workflows that have already been spawned and are still running via use of `WorkflowIDConflictPolicy.USE_EXISTING`. As `WorkflowIDConflictPolicy` cannot be specified in `temporalio.workflow.start_child_workflow`, this is currently not possible.\n\nThe workaround is to simply use the default and except the error that is thrown when an existing workflow has the same ID, however, this does not allow you to retrieve the workflow handle.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd an argument to `temporalio.workflow.start_child_workflow` that specifies a `WorkflowIDConflictPolicy`.\n\n### Additional context\n\nn/a\n","closedAt":"2025-07-23T18:57:59Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c65W47c","author":{"login":"tconley1428"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This isn't an issue specific to the Python SDK, the server does not support this mechanism.
