In Rust and Python, worker creation is a synchronous task w/ an existing already-connected client. If we make that lazy on the Python side, we have to make worker creation async on the Python side which I think is a bit confusing. Also we can't defer client connection to worker start because we want to eagerly create the worker in Rust so it can do its validation on worker construction. For now I just disallow lazy clients to be used for workers.\r\n\r\nIMO we need to support lazy connectivity in core. It's not quite right that Rust worker creation gets to be sync but language-level does not.","createdAt":"2022-09-06T22:32:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/92#issuecomment-1238718382","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-08-03T17:07:10Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":92,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Lazy connectivity for client and healthCheck","updatedAt":"2022-09-07T22:29:18Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/92"}
