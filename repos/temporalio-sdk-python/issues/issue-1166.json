Please describe.\n\nPython allows a class to have methods decorated as activities\nThose methods may accept only self or self and one arg. They are callable.\nThe type hint for execute_activity does not work for that though because it expects no args or one arg.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nPlease update the type hint to work for this use case OR provide a new decorator activity_method which will conform to this type hint.
