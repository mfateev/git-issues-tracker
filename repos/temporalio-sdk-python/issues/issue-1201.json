We need to do two things here:\n* Prevent creating things with a runtime created in a different process\n  * Basically do the exact same thing we did in Ruby: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/pull/301\n* Allow users to opt-out of default runtime use\n  * This means add something like `Runtime.prevent_default()` that will prevent any invocation of `Runtime.default()`\n  * Clients and replayers and test environments use `Runtime.default` today which lazily creates runtime, but advanced users want to prevent accidentally doing this\n  * `Runtime.prevent_default()` should error if it's called after a default has been created","closedAt":"2025-11-17T20:22:51Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-31T18:28:09Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1201,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Better prevention of accidental `Runtime` use over forks","updatedAt":"2025-11-17T20:22:51Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1201"}
