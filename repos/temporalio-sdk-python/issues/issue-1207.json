Yes, sorry. Id like to have a way to share current \"whats happening\" or final \"whats failed\" with the client (For UI or some decision-making on the client)\n\nNow the client can get status and history of events.

For \"current details\", that's actually powered by a Temporal query named `__temporal_workflow_metadata` which returns a proto JSON'd result of https://github.com/temporalio/api/blob/master/temporal/api/sdk/v1/workflow_metadata.proto's `WorkflowMetadata` which includes current detail as obtained from the workflow code, it is not in history or on the server at any time.\n\nYou can write your own query that can return anything you want too and it can be called even after a workflow is closed.","createdAt":"2025-11-07T20:51:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1207#issuecomment-3504892952","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-11-06T07:24:58Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1207,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add a clean way to extract failure cause from client side","updatedAt":"2025-12-04T17:20:51Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1207"}
