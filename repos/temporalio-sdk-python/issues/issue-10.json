Please describe.\r\n\r\nRight now our Linux wheel is named `temporalio-0.1a1.dev1-cp37-abi3-manylinux_2_31_x86_64.whl`. This means it only works on glibc 2.31+ per https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/platform-compatibility-tags/.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe can use manylinux container to get Linux builds that work with a wider range of linuxes (e.g. `manylinux2010` or `manylinux2014`). We need to investigate the effort/value of this.","closedAt":"2022-07-01T15:26:04Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-03-15T20:06:27Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":10,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Investigate more generic manylinux support","updatedAt":"2022-07-01T15:26:04Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/10"}
