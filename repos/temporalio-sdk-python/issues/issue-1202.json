This should probably be exposed as `ServiceClient.unsafe_close()` and be documented with wording like \"users should not use this, and the behavior of any use of clients or things relying on clients after this call is undefined\". Whether this drops the client from a Rust POV (e.g. we put it in an option and _take_ it on close) or we add a Core method to help with this is up to the implementer/discussion.\n\nThis should also include a test (even if platform specific) that confirms the socket is closed on return from that call.","closedAt":"2025-12-10T16:50:31Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c7Y2Ah3","author":{"login":"VegetarianOrc"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"After some internal discussion, we'll be looking to provide a way to cleanly exit powered by some server side changes.","createdAt":"2025-12-10T16:50:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1202#issuecomment-3638036599","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-10-31T18:31:46Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1202,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Advanced, unsafe ability to close the client","updatedAt":"2025-12-10T16:50:31Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1202"}
