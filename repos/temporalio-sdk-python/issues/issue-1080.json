Same major version is required. See Protobuf version guarantees at https://protobuf.dev/support/cross-version-runtime-guarantee.\n\nWe have other dependencies that need a minimum protobuf version 31.1. Can you please update the underlying protobuf/grpc versions so that it works with newer gencode?\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n1. Generate a Python protocol buffer library using the latest version protoc.\n2. Attempt to load that library into a module that also depends on the Temporal python SDK.\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\n- Temporal Version: 1.17.0\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\n","closedAt":"2025-09-16T16:01:49Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-05T17:19:16Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1080,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Unable to import generated protocol buffer code","updatedAt":"2025-09-16T16:01:49Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1080"}
