Also, per https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/1083#pullrequestreview-3194906671, we should consider erroring if the data converter is provided with a non-default payload converter (since we are overriding it). Or we could error only if the user-provided payload converter is not what we need (Pydantic with a setting set). There could be discussions on advanced user payload converter customization on top of the one OpenAI plugin sets, but that can wait until needed.","closedAt":"2025-09-09T17:18:38Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-08T15:23:40Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1084,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Do not clobber user payload codec in OpenAI plugin","updatedAt":"2025-09-09T17:18:38Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1084"}
