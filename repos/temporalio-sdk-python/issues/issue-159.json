The name is only qualified to the class level, not higher. We can find a way to qualify this (can get complicated with inheritance and modules and such), or just remove the type hint cache. If we start storing the type hints on the definitions of things themselves, the need for a cache may be obviated.\r\n\r\nAlso, please test that `typing.Set[foo]` as a return type works with client. Preliminary review shows that we are excluded return type hints that don't satisfy `inspect.isclass` which these typing wrappers do not.","closedAt":"2022-10-28T16:50:14Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-10-18T16:40:33Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":159,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Function type hint lookup cache key is bad","updatedAt":"2022-10-28T16:50:14Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/159"}
