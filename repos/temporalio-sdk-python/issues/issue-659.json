Many users create many workflows/activities and only start some of them in some workers and others in other workers (some may even have the same name). I would recommend maintaining a `dict` of workflows/activities if you need a form of global lookup. This can be done with a custom decorator if needed.","createdAt":"2024-10-07T13:32:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/659#issuecomment-2396949403","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6O5U84","author":{"login":"funkindy"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I see, thank you.
