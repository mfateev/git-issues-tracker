Also since updates are always run-specific, when using \"start\", the update handle should use the returned run ID regardless of what user passed in (but can still leave optional when using getter). And for the update-handle getter, we should document very clearly the consequences of getting an update handle on a workflow handle with no run ID.","closedAt":"2024-05-20T20:23:48Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-11-13T13:18:33Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":424,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] add get update handle and set run ID","updatedAt":"2024-05-20T20:23:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/424"}
