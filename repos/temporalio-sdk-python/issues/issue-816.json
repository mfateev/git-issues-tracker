This also may solve #300.\n\nNote at https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/blob/92b77589204a0733f49b5d081942fc9303e436c4/temporalio/bridge/src/runtime.rs#L366-L408 we had to copy over some pyo3-asyncio code because it only supported a spawning from a global Tokio runtime and we needed to spawn from the current one. Make sure that pyo3-async-runtimes can handle this properly.","closedAt":"2025-06-12T16:32:11Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6leFRt","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"See https://community.temporal.io/t/support-for-graalpy/17029 for context on why this was created.
