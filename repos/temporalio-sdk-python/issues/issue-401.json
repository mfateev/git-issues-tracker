Please describe.\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make pattern when i do activity and wait activity done(using signal).\r\nAccording to signal state i want to trigger activity retry logic will be executed.\r\n\r\nHere's my current pattern\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    await workflow.execute_activity(\r\n        acvitiy_1,\r\n        args = [\r\n            arg1,\r\n            arg2,\r\n            arg3,\r\n            ],\r\n        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=3),\r\n    )\r\n    await workflow.execute_activity(\r\n        acvitiy_1,\r\n        args = [\r\n            arg1,\r\n            arg2,\r\n            arg3,\r\n            ],\r\n        start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=3),\r\n    )\r\n    try:\r\n        await workflow.wait_condition(lambda: <condition>, timeout=timedelta(minutes=5))\r\n    except:\r\n        raise ApplicationError(<Error Message>)\r\n...\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIn this pattern, i wait condition related to temporal signal and if condition makes True, next step will be executed.\r\nBut when i got signal failed so condition is False or timeout error is occured, i want to execute activity again which is failed using _**Temporal Retry Policy**_. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI know i can add for loop or something else in python, but i want to use temporal pattern.
