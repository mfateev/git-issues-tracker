We have quite a few Python services running in our backend. So I was wondering, can you maybe share a bit on the roadmap for this Python SDK? Among other things, I'm wondering how soon it will be mature enough to put on production, or at least leave the alpha stage.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closedAt":"2022-04-06T15:03:49Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5A_dVx","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Sure. Basically we've split into three phases. See the proposals at https://github.com/temporalio/proposals/tree/master/python for the first two. Of course implementation changes the proposal details. Phase 1 has already been implemented. Phase 2 is under active development and hopefully can get to beta shortly thereafter (I'm afraid I don't have specific dates). The API will hopefully not move too much after that.\r\n\r\nWe admittedly are missing pre-built wheels for macOS M1 and Linux ARM, but we'll get those soon. To chat about the Python SDK, feel free join `#python-sdk` on Slack at https://temporal.io/slack or our forum at https://community.temporal.io/.\r\n\r\n(closing as not an outstanding issue, but feel free to continue commenting)","createdAt":"2022-04-06T15:03:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/19#issuecomment-1090377073","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-04-06T14:36:05Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":19,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Roadmap","updatedAt":"2022-04-06T15:04:38Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/19"}
