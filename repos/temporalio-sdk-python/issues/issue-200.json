This may also occur on `isinstance` for data classes, need to check.\r\n\r\nNot exactly sure what to do here. Maybe re-reference the full type's qualified name when converting instead of reusing the type hint itself?","closedAt":"2022-11-15T22:00:14Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5OWlwl","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We've had similar issues in TS when passing around object between v8 contexts.\r\nOur solution was to instantiate everything in the proper context but I understand that's not feasible with the Python sandboxing approach.","createdAt":"2022-11-14T23:29:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/200#issuecomment-1314544677","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5OWn2g","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It might be feasible.
