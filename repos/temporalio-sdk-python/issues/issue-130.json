Please describe.\r\n\r\nClient can install custom interceptors that work on most of outbound requests, except `get_workflow_execution_history()`, i.e., no interceptors could run on:\r\n```\r\nwf_handle = client.get_workflow_handle(wf_id)\r\nawait wf_handle.result()\r\n```\r\nNote that `wf_handle.describe()` does invoke the interceptors, but not wf_handle.result().\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nFor completeness of the interceptor as plugin, there should be at least a way for OutboundInterceptor to run before get_workflow_execution_history().\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI'm building a cross-cutting layer on top of Temporal via the interceptor, which needs to make runtime changes to workflow id and task queue name (e.g., append <hostname-pid> suffix to workflow id for a shared testing namespace)\r\n","closedAt":"2022-11-01T21:40:21Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5KO7Zh","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Currently none of our SDKs offer an interceptor for `result`.
