For example, it seems that in Python a poll request might be able to target a different update with the same update ID, that exists in a post-CAN or post-reset run.","closedAt":"2024-12-19T18:06:02Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-12-16T18:27:50Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":704,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Run ID should be set in update handle","updatedAt":"2024-12-19T18:06:02Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/704"}
