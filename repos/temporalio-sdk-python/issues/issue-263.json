Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are calling https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor but we are not propagating the contextvars.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nSince there is no way with `run_in_executor` and we don't want to use `to_thread` as suggested at https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/78195 because it doesn't use a custom executor, we need to just populate the context ourselves. This of course won't work with process pool executor.","closedAt":"2023-02-08T11:19:43Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-01-30T13:24:49Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":263,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Populate contextvars for threaded activities","updatedAt":"2023-02-08T11:19:43Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/263"}
