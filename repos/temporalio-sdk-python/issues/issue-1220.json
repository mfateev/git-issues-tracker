Potentially that's configuration or version dependent. Regardless, this overload doesn't actually expand the range of valid types, as `Callable` would fit the protocol of `MethodSyncOrAsyncNoParam`. That would indicate it is a PyCharm bug, not one for which we should introduce a new overload for all users.","createdAt":"2025-12-02T16:52:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1220#issuecomment-3603024082","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-11-23T22:12:41Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1220,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add typing for signal for PyCharm","updatedAt":"2025-12-02T16:52:18Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1220"}
