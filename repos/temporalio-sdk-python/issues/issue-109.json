Please describe.\r\n\r\nSome input requires `timedelta`, but Python devs are used to just passing in a float of seconds. Right now only on `wait_condition` do we accept floats, everywhere else we require timedeltas.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nEverywhere that we accept duration input we should accept a timedelta or a float/int of seconds. But keep timedeltas as the way we show durations.","closedAt":"2022-09-06T15:30:49Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5JzyUG","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is really changing a lot of stuff. I am not sure this is ok, In addition to confusion of `Union[timedelta, float]` everywhere (represented as `temporalio.common.Duration: TypeAlias = Union[timedelta, float]`), some bidirectional values in places like `RetryPolicy` will have this which means I will be asking everyone to call either `temporalio.common.duration_to_timedelta()` or `temporalio.common.duration_to_total_seconds()` which is a bit unwieldy. It's clearer leaving these all as one type everywhere.\r\n\r\nClosing as won't fix.","createdAt":"2022-09-06T15:30:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/109#issuecomment-1238312198","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5JzzEo","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"But I will be changing everywhere we accept a float to match Python API to also take a timedelta for clarity.","createdAt":"2022-09-06T15:33:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/109#issuecomment-1238315304","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-08-18T19:03:26Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":109,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support timedelta | float | int for all user-facing duration input","updatedAt":"2022-09-06T15:33:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/109"}
