Move the interceptor create/init to the _end_ of the workflow instance constructor.","closedAt":"2025-06-05T21:57:53Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-19T13:55:47Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":874,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Workflow interceptors initialized before some attributes set in instance constructor","updatedAt":"2025-06-05T21:57:53Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/874"}
