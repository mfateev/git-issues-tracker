What's the recommended way to integrate? the `OpenAIAgentsPlugin` or `set_open_ai_agent_temporal_overrides`? If plugin, any plan to cut a release with latest changes?\n3.

We do plan to support streaming. It's on the roadmap.\n2. `OpenAIAgentsPlugin` is intended to be the only usage method. It released last night: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/releases/tag/1.15.0, with samples and readme updates in the works to align to that new model.\n3. It is safe to use both. You can look at the plugin implementation which is quite small to identify the set of changes. The only one of particular concern is that other workflows will have to use the `pydantic_data_converter`. This is generally not a bad idea anyway since it is more robust than our built in one, but for some scenarios it could be problematic. For instance, adding it into an existing worker with histories may not work as the conversion process would differ.\n\nI'll repurpose this issue specifically to track the streaming support request.
