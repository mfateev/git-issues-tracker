We should allow `TimeoutError` to be considered a standard workflow failure exception. We consider this a backwards compatible change because turning what would have been task failures to no longer be task failures is considered safe.","closedAt":"2025-04-10T19:39:07Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-03-25T18:21:50Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":798,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Consider TimeoutError as a workflow failure exception","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T19:39:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/798"}
