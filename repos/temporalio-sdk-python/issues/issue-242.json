Please describe.\r\n\r\nNeed opt-in catch-alls for workflows, activities, signals, and queries.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nShould be able to register only one workflow as \"dynamic\" and it is given the name as a string as the first arg, then `*args: Payload` as second arg. This means we also need to provide the users of a workflow access to their payload converter to convert those.\r\n\r\nNeed to do the same for activity.\r\n\r\nFor signal and query handlers, we already have `dynamic=True`, but we foolishly allow already-decoded args. Ideally, we would change to require payloads. But since that may be a breaking change, we should just args hinted as payloads pass through unconverted.","closedAt":"2023-07-14T20:27:57Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-01-05T13:50:38Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":242,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Support dynamic workflows, activities, signals, and queries","updatedAt":"2023-07-14T20:27:57Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/242"}
