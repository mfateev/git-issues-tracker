Our last alpha release only had a limited number of wheels pre-built (because it is alpha):\r\n\r\n* Windows x64\r\n* macOS x64\r\n* macOS arm64\r\n* Linux x64 for libc >= 2.31\r\n\r\nThese can be seen at https://pypi.org/project/temporalio/0.1a2/#files. You only need Rust if you aren't on one of those platforms. The next release, coming soon, will support more including Linux x64 for libc >= 2.17 and Linux arm64. If you want to use these wheels now, you can get them as artifacts on the latest successful master build (so https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/actions/runs/2712855146).\r\n\r\nSo after next release, only in rare environments would you ever need Rust.","createdAt":"2022-07-22T17:49:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}},{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/85#issuecomment-1192806149","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5HGaAV","author":{"login":"vincent-lecrubier-skydio"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Cool, indeed, being on ubuntu bionic with libc 2.27, I had to build, couldn't use the wheel.\r\n\r\nThank you @cretz !","createdAt":"2022-07-22T19:09:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/85#issuecomment-1192861717","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5H-Ejc","author":{"login":"vincent-lecrubier-skydio"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I was excited to see version 0.1b1 was released, but it does not have a linux aarch64 wheel. \r\n\r\nAnd for some reason, Trying to install a wheel from github gives me the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#0 1.250 ERROR: temporalio-0.1b1-cp37-abi3-manylinux2014_aarch64.manylinux_2_17_aarch64.whl is not a supported wheel on this platform.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor reference I am trying to build this:\r\n\r\n```dockerfile\r\n# This is a docker image based on Alpine, containing Temporalio only\r\nFROM python:3.10.4-alpine\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n\r\nCOPY temporalio-0.1b1-cp37-abi3-manylinux2014_aarch64.manylinux_2_17_aarch64.whl temporalio-0.1b1-cp37-abi3-manylinux2014_aarch64.manylinux_2_17_aarch64.whl\r\n\r\n# Install Python pakages, including temporalio\r\nRUN python -m pip install \\\r\n  asyncio==3.4.3 \\\r\n  /app/temporalio-0.1b1-cp37-abi3-manylinux2014_aarch64.manylinux_2_17_aarch64.whl\r\n\r\n# Run everything\r\nCOPY . .\r\nCMD [\"sh\", \"-c\", \"python -m worker.worker\"]\r\n```","createdAt":"2022-08-07T17:42:17Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/85#issuecomment-1207453916","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5IAgBV","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@vincent-lecrubier-skydio - Thanks for testing this for us.
