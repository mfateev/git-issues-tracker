The `zip` patch was included with https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/802 I think just as a side-effect of the other work done in that change.","closedAt":"2025-04-29T17:31:00Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6mfKA4","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We plan on making our next release soon, though no exact date","createdAt":"2025-04-10T13:45:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/824#issuecomment-2793185336","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6pQiFv","author":{"login":"dandavison"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This was released in https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/releases/tag/1.11.0","createdAt":"2025-04-29T17:31:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/824#issuecomment-2839683439","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-04-10T12:56:58Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":824,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Release] Cut a new release to address CVE-2025-29787","updatedAt":"2025-04-29T17:31:02Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/824"}
