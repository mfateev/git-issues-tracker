Please describe.\n\nCurrently, the Temporal Python SDK enforces a fixed 2-second deadlock detection timeout for workflows. This behavior cannot be configured in production: the only way to disable it is to run in debug_mode or set TEMPORAL_DEBUG.\n\nThis creates friction for production workflows that legitimately need longer CPU-bound or blocking sections. Unlike the Go SDK, which allows configuring WorkerOptions.DeadlockDetectionTimeout, the Python SDK forces developers to restructure code even in cases where a slightly longer threshold would be sufficient.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIntroduce a configurable deadlock detection timeout for the Python SDK, similar to Go’s DeadlockDetectionTimeout option.\n\nExample proposal:\n\n```\nworker = Worker(\n    client,\n    task_queue=\"my-task-queue\",\n    workflows=[MyWorkflow],\n    activities=[...],\n    deadlock_detection_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)  # new option\n)\n```\n\nDefault remains 2 seconds (to preserve current behavior).\n\nUsers can override the timeout per worker in production.\n\nSetting None (or 0) could fully disable the check, mirroring debug mode.\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n","closedAt":"2025-08-26T20:40:28Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6_3QoT","author":{"login":"SanilK2108"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I’d be happy to contribute this feature and open a PR to add configurable deadlock detection timeout support to the Python SDK.","createdAt":"2025-08-25T05:58:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1050#issuecomment-3218934291","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c7APEOs","author":{"login":"Sushisource"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@SanilK2108 ~We would welcome a PR!~ Actually, after some discussion with the team we're pretty sure we want to keep this limited purposefully.
