Please describe.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is basically undefined how core will work across forks. We do know it fails. For example, the client var, when copied across the fork, has Rust file descriptors copied for the gRPC stuff that fail during Rust drop when the child process's version of the var is GC'd.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe need to, without leak, make sure that `fork` does not fail unless you explicitly use something from across the fork, at which point it should fail. No surprise failures like on implicit Python GC failure during drop.\r\n\r\nI don't know how yet to do this.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-03-15T20:27:43Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":11,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}},{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Test client/worker/core behavior across fork","updatedAt":"2022-03-15T20:27:43Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/11"}
