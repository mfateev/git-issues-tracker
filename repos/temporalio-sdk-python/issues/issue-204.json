Please describe.\r\n\r\nRight now you have to configure the sandbox runner w/ unstable APIs. Needs to have a simpler way.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nProbably a simple `with`, so something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom temporalio import activity, workflow\r\n\r\nwith workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through():\r\n    import requests\r\n    import urllib3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny concern that users would abuse it? I could also do something w/ AST/comments, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport requests # temporal: pass-through\r\nimport urllib3 # temporal: pass-through\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, maybe I could (also) just make this easier at the worker level by accepting a set of `workflow_sandbox_passthrough_modules` on the worker constructor?","closedAt":"2022-12-02T21:13:03Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-11-16T21:21:36Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":204,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Make it easier to pass through third party modules","updatedAt":"2022-12-02T21:13:03Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/204"}
