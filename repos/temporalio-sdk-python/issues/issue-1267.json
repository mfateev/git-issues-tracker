This is used by the replay safe logger to determine if to drop logs or not so I assume this is why we have this behaviour.\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c7eVDLV","author":{"login":"tconley1428"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It's intentional that `is_replaying` is true, but the side effect of not emitting logs isn't.
