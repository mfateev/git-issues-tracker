The problem is worker plugins have a lot of config that a replayer does not, but there are important shared things like interceptors. We're going to have to decide which option we want, here are a few:\n\n* Add `configure_replayer` + `run_replayer` on `worker.Plugin` making every plugin author to add extra code to configure common things like interceptors\n* Try to reuse `configure_worker` + `run_worker` knowing there are a ton of config options and worker instance stuff that doesn't overlap\n* Have a completely separate `worker.ReplayerPlugin` which has same problem as first bullet, but at least will give type error when trying to register when creating replayer\n\nThis same problem will need to be solved in other languages too. The third is probably the best so we can keep API clean and plugin authors can just choose not to support replayer if they want.","closedAt":"2025-08-07T00:04:03Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-24T18:24:31Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":994,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Worker plugin support for replayers","updatedAt":"2025-08-07T00:04:03Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/994"}
