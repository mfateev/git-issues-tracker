But we still fail the workflow task if the arity is off, e.g. with Python exceptions like \"missing 1 required positional argument\". Try to make sure there is one argument for every required parameter and no more than accepted (varargs notwithstanding). May be easiest to have a min/max param count on the `_SignalDefinition` and just check against that.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-07-24T22:22:52Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":355,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Log and drop signals that pass the wrong number of arguments","updatedAt":"2023-07-24T22:22:52Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/355"}
