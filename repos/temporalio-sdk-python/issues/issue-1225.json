A client's config contains the options it was configured with, and so does a workers. The combined plugin list should not be in config IMO. People use config to change-and-resplat, e.g. new_config = old_worker.config() + Worker(**new_config).\n\n> Arguably we should not be storing the plugin-mutated config in self._config for that reason too.\n\n\nAlso see https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/1157#pullrequestreview-3505399150 for more context.\n\n> Client.config() and Worker.config() need to represent immutable copies of the exact kwargs passed in to constructor or at least be sure they can be passed in to another constructor","closedAt":"2025-12-02T19:09:44Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-11-25T17:41:54Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1225,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Client.config() and Worker.config() should represent immutable copies of exact kwargs passed in","updatedAt":"2025-12-02T19:09:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1225"}
