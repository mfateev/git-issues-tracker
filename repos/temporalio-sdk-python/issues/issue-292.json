Please describe.\r\nIn some cases, activity and workflow implementations should be loaded dynamically. It is similar to the way the Java app engines load applications using class loaders.\r\n\r\nDescribe the solution you'd like\r\nExpose an extension point for dynamic activity loading. While the SDK might not provide the explicit loading mechanism it should provide a factory interface that is called with activity or workflow type to provide an untyped activity implementation.\r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\nThis feature has been added to java sdk as part of issue #245\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/245\r\n\r\nhttps://community.temporal.io/t/dynamic-activities-registration-at-runtime-and-worker-splitting/930/7","closedAt":"2023-03-02T20:06:52Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c5WkxKM","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as duplicate of #242 ","createdAt":"2023-03-02T20:06:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/292#issuecomment-1452479116","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-03-02T20:06:10Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":292,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support dynamic activity and workflow implementations","updatedAt":"2023-03-02T20:06:52Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/292"}
