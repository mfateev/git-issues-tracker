This value should ideally be provided as a hash of the complete source code and must change only when the code itself changes.\n> \n> If not explicitly set, the system automatically generates a best-effort identifier by traversing and computing hashes of all modules in the codebase. In very large codebases this automatic process may significantly increase initialization time.","closedAt":"2025-10-22T16:08:38Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-14T21:59:12Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":1160,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Modify code comment for Worker build_id field","updatedAt":"2025-10-22T16:08:38Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1160"}
