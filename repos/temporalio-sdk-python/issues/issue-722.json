Make this also work for users that have opted out of sandboxing (if, as suspected reading the PR, it doesn't actually work already)\r\n2. Add a test to confirm the deadlock stack trace represents (couldn't see such a test in the PR)\r\n3. We append `(no frames available)` or `(failed getting frames: {err})` when we couldn't capture the threads trace, but we should also add something like `(no thread ID available)` if the earlier condition occurs where for some reason we don't have a thread ID at all.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-08T22:38:17Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":722,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Stack trace on deadlock exception improvements","updatedAt":"2025-01-08T22:38:17Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/722"}
