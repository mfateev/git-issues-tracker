But they still fail.\n\nSpecifically, when running in Python 3.13 (and maybe others) with time skipping test server, all permutations of `test_unfinished_handler_on_workflow_termination` that use `handler_type` `update`, `handler_waiting` `no-wait-all-handlers-finish`, and `workflow_termination_type` `continue-as-new` fail with \"workflow execution already completed\".\n\nTo replicate, run:\n\n    poe test -s --log-cli-level=DEBUG --workflow-environment time-skipping -k test_unfinished_handler_on_workflow_termination\n\nTo see the failure. Leaving tests skipped for now.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-04-10T16:53:11Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":826,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Bug] test_unfinished_handler_on_workflow_termination fails in some situations with time skipping and update","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T16:54:41Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/826"}
