I want to raise an ApplicationError and get this back to the workflow so it can decide on appropriate next steps to take.\n\n### Describe the bug\nMy understanding is that the Agent SDK wraps/catches the ApplicationError and raises it as a UserError.  This causes the workflow task after the failed activity to also fail and gets stuck like this without ever moving forward.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\nStarting from the https://github.com/temporal-community/openai-agents-demos repository look to run the tools workflow (run_tools_workflow.py)  having edited the get_weather_activity.py to make it raise an ApplicationError that is non-retryable.\n\n### Environment/Versions\nTemporal python SDK 1.15.0\nopenai-agents 0.2.7\n\n### Additional context\n\nNone\n","closedAt":"2025-09-03T19:00:30Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-08-27T14:05:02Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1058,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] OpenAI Agent SDK wraps Temporal ApplicationError preventing workflow acting on it","updatedAt":"2025-09-03T19:00:30Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1058"}
