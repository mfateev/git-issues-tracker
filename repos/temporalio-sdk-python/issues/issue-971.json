Part of configuring logging for our application involves patching the `workflow.logger` and `activity.logger` to drop contextual information out of the log message while keeping that in the logging extras.\n\nAn example of how our application configures logging is approximately the following:\n\n```python\nfrom temporalio import activity, workflow\n\ndef my_app_configure_logging():\n    ....\n    # configure workflow logger\n    workflow.logger.workflow_info_on_message = False\n    workflow.logger.workflow_info_on_extra = True        # default\n    workflow.logger.full_workflow_info_on_extra = False  # default\n    workflow.logger.log_during_replay = False            # default\n\n    # configure activity logger\n    activity.logger.activity_info_on_message = False\n    activity.logger.activity_info_on_extra = True        # default\n    activity.logger.full_activity_info_on_extra = True   # default\n```\n\nThis works as expected, we get the logging exactly like we want to see it. The one thing I wonder about is if this is the right way to configure this.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA user-facing interface to configure logging for activities and workflow loggers. e.g. exposing a function that holds the user arguments explicitly with their defaults. e.g. `temporal.workflow.configure_logging`\n\n```python\ndef configure_logging(\n    *,\n    info_on_message: bool = True,\n    info_on_extra: bool = True,\n    full_info_on_extra: bool = False,\n    log_during_replay: bool = False,\n) -> None:\n    pass\n```\n","closedAt":"2025-07-15T17:46:54Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c63N15m","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> The one thing I wonder about is if this is the right way to configure this.\n\nIt is, and is why we made these attributes visible on the logger adapter (and the logger adapter itself visible). We even clearly document them, e.g. https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.workflow.LoggerAdapter.html. Though of course there's no need to set attributes that are already set with the default, so it sounds like you just need to set an attribute on each adapter.","createdAt":"2025-07-15T14:29:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/971#issuecomment-3073859174","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c63Q4vQ","author":{"login":"teije01"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Thanks!
