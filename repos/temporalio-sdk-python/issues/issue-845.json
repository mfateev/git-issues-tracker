It should fail the WFT. See https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/221\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n```python\n@workflow.defn\nclass MissingLocalActivityWorkflow:\n    @workflow.run\n    async def run(self, name: str) -> str:\n        return await workflow.execute_local_activity(\n            \"whatever\", name, schedule_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=5)\n        )\n\n\nasync def test_workflow_missing_local_activity(client: Client):\n    async with new_worker(\n        client, MissingLocalActivityWorkflow, activities=[say_hello]\n    ) as worker:\n        result = await client.execute_workflow(\n            MissingLocalActivityWorkflow.run,\n            \"Temporal\",\n            id=f\"workflow-{uuid.uuid4()}\",\n            task_queue=worker.task_queue,\n        )\n        assert result == \"Hello, Temporal!\"\n\n\n```","closedAt":"2025-05-12T18:04:30Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-04-22T23:04:14Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":845,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Missing Local Activites should fail WFT rather than retry-looping","updatedAt":"2025-05-12T18:04:30Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/845"}
