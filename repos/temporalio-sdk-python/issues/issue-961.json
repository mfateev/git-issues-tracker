Please describe.\n\nCurrently, the signal() method in Temporal's Python SDK WorkflowHandle doesn't allow passing custom headers to the workflow signal. While there's an rpc_metadata parameter for RPC-level headers, there's no way to pass workflow-level headers that would be accessible within the workflow code. \n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like to add an optional headers parameter to the signal() method that would be passed through to the SignalWorkflowInput. The method signature would become:\n\n```python3\nasync def signal(\n    self,\n    signal: Union[str, Callable],\n    arg: Any = temporalio.common._arg_unset,\n    *,\n    args: Sequence[Any] = [],\n    headers: Mapping[str, temporalio.api.common.v1.Payloads] = {},  # New parameter\n    rpc_metadata: Mapping[str, str] = {},\n    rpc_timeout: Optional[timedelta] = None,\n) -> None:\n    ...\n```","closedAt":"2025-08-05T10:09:05Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c62-g9f","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Temporal headers are intentionally only set via interceptors because they are meant for implicit setting and not explicit by callers.

Our OpenTelemetry contrib implementation/interceptor also uses headers to relay serialized spans.","createdAt":"2025-07-14T14:33:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/961#issuecomment-3069841247","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-07-14T04:26:02Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":961,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add optional headers parameter to WorkflowHandle.signal() and Workflow.execute_update()/Workflow.start_update()","updatedAt":"2025-08-05T12:29:21Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/961"}
