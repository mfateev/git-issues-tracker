Regarding implementation, one possibility is that this will involve a custom transport that responds to `tools/list` and `tools/call` calls by making activity calls, making use of an activity-local activity worker to implement stateful sessions, as implemented in https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/1021. This may be similar to [nexus-mcp-python:nexusmcp/workflow_transport.py](https://github.com/bergundy/nexus-mcp-python/blob/main/nexusmcp/workflow_transport.py), adapted to use activities.\n\nSubsequent versions should allow fully durable/fault-tolerant tool calls / client sessions, i.e. making use of durable execution primitives such as workflows exposed as MCP tools. This may involve adding options to make the transport use nexus operations in addition to activities.
