I use the `pydantic_data_converter`.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nBefore calling the `execute_workflow` the value is as expected, but in the activity the value is all \"*\", instead of the value itself.\n\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\nI created a minimal reproduction of the bug in the samples-python repo:\nThe code is [here](https://github.com/yeger00/samples-python/tree/secretstr-bug/pydantic_converter\n) (the commit is [here](https://github.com/yeger00/samples-python/commit/95d2d738b0c4ab708f7ef25e5ea43cbabae824f2))\n\nThe logs - as you can see before the value is printed as expected, and after the value is all \"*\":\nINFO:root:models secret: super secret\nINFO:root:Got secret from client: **********\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\n<!-- Please complete the following information where relevant. -->\n\n- OS and processor: M1 Mac\n- Temporal Version: temporal version 1.3.0 (Server 1.27.1, UI 2.36.0)\n- Are you using Docker or Kubernetes or building Temporal from source? \n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\n","closedAt":"2025-06-07T20:07:28Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6v3Znh","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"From the linked doc:\n\n> The SecretStr and SecretBytes will be formatted as either '**********' or '' on conversion to json.\n\nIt seems Pydantic intentionally doesn't allow serialization of this value.
