Therefore you can perform whatever conflict resolution you'd like instead of the limited set offered by this value. We recommend using `WorkflowAlreadyStartedError` and consider it a healthy use of try/except. You can wrap it in a helper if needed, but I am not sure we want to do this helper (this is shown as an error in history, and we think it's important for code and history to be clear on these things).","createdAt":"2024-07-18T13:17:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/587#issuecomment-2236488481","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6FYGbn","author":{"login":"johnny-smitherson"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Ah yes I see - for child tasks i can do\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n        return await workflow.execute_child_workflow(\r\n            ...\r\n            id=the_id\r\n        )\r\n    except WorkflowAlreadyStartedError:\r\n        handle = await workflow.get_external_workflow_handle(the_id)\r\n        return await handle.result()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's more or less `USE_EXISTING` of the new param\r\n\r\nor instead of `handle.result()`, I would terminate and restart to obtain the other behaviors of the param\r\n\r\nThanks!","createdAt":"2024-07-18T21:55:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/587#issuecomment-2237687527","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGusT1c6FYRq3","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"`get_external_workflow_handle` does not return a handle with `result`. Getting a non-child result of a workflow from another workflow directly is not supported. Rather, if that already exists as a child, it means you started it some other time in your workflow. You can store that child handle on the class and access its result. If you need the result of a workflow that was not started as a child, you may have to break out into an activity and use the Temporal client.","createdAt":"2024-07-18T22:34:57Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/587#issuecomment-2237733559","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-07-18T09:54:10Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":587,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] add \"id_conflict_policy\" arg for \"execute_child_workflow\"","updatedAt":"2024-07-18T22:35:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/587"}
