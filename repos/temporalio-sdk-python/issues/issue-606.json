Ideally, all Core langs (really, all of them, but we won't go back to change that) follow that model - state is updated synchronously, then stuff runs until we're blocked.\r\n\r\nThere is a really nice test [here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1488/files#diff-edcae2d23017bc07e3a859b68e980d151947323c04128f2bc08147bda4a1d7deR2512) @mjameswh added that I think all async languages should have some form of that helps us understand exactly how routines will proceed.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if making this change will actually have consequences to the _realized_ python behavior. In any case it should probably be protected with a flag if we make it.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-08-13T21:33:26Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":606,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Consider aligning activation job application with TS changes","updatedAt":"2024-08-13T21:33:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/606"}
