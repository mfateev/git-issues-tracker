Please describe.\r\n\r\nSupport for Eager Workflow Start was added in the server in 1.20, and is currently supported in Java and Go SDKs. It \r\nreduces the latency to start a workflow by allowing the client to directly schedule the first workflow task to a local worker. See https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/242 for details.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make Python the first core-based SDK to support Eager Workflow Start after is enabled in Core. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThis mechanism is mostly transparent to the Python SDK client, but we need to add a flag `enable_eager_start` to `client.start_workflow` to use it. It will default to `False` while the core implementation is considered experimental.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis depends on https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/606\r\n","closedAt":"2023-11-27T17:59:43Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-09-25T19:29:24Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":388,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Eager workflow start","updatedAt":"2023-11-27T17:59:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/388"}
