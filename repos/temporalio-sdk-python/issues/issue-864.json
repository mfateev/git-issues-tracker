We need some kind of clear string they can use as a conditional instead of checking English message patrterns. Research the best way to provide this (e.g. on `extra`?). This only _needs_ to be logging done on activity failures and workflow task failures at this time, but may be able to apply to other `warning` logs or similar situations.\n\nAlso a sample showing how to customize log level for workflow task failure would be helpful here once this issue is done.","closedAt":"2025-06-10T16:08:51Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-12T16:27:41Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":864,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add some kind of extra on some logs for easier identification","updatedAt":"2025-06-10T16:08:51Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/864"}
