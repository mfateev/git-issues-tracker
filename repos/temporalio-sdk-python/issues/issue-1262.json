For `ApplicationErrors` that are deserialized, we should make the `details` property lazy, have a property for obtaining the raw details (that only works if raw details were set on create, i.e. in deserialization situations), and have a method that lets you access a detail by index and type hint.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-12-29T15:19:00Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1262,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Bug] Add ability to obtain `ApplicationError` details with type hint","updatedAt":"2025-12-29T15:19:00Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1262"}
