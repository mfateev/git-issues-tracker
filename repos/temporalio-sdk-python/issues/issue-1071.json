Not only must we make sure _every_ non-search attribute payload is decoded on activation and encoded on completion, we must write a test to ensure this for all future payloads.\n\nThe ideal way forward here would be to write a general code generated payload visitor utility that everyone can use, even ourselves. We have done this in Go and Ruby. The visitor could be used for this. It would also help solve https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/468.","closedAt":"2025-09-10T21:13:22Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-02T13:54:30Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHK","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1071,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Ensure every inbound and outbound workflow payload goes through codec","updatedAt":"2025-09-10T21:13:22Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1071"}
