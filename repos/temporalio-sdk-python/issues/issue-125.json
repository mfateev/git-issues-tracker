Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently we have a top-level call for preparing telemetry in `temporalio.bridge.telemetry`. This implies that telemetry is global, meaning you have to configure things for the entire process without the option of having worker-specific settings.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI would hope this doesn't last forever and therefore we can remove this top-level call (though there is a default that is still global). For now we need to make it clear on the API that this may not last forever. We have also resisted moving this to a more public-facing package for this reason.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/384","closedAt":"2022-09-07T22:29:15Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-09-02T14:10:49Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGusT1c7gQgHN","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":125,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Mark global tracing options as experimental","updatedAt":"2022-09-07T22:29:15Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/125"}
