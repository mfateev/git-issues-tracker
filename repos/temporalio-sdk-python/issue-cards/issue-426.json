  "summary": "Feature request to implement `is_running` method on the Temporal Python workflow event loop to better conform to `AbstractEventLoop` interface. The method is needed for compatibility with libraries like aiokafka and aiohttp that expect this standard asyncio method to be implemented.",

  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users attempting to use standard Python asyncio libraries (aiohttp, aiokafka) within workflows encounter NotImplementedError when those libraries call `is_running()` on the event loop.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal's `_WorkflowInstanceImpl` is not a complete implementation of `AbstractEventLoop` - it lacks the `is_running()` method that standard libraries expect to exist.",
  "proposedFix": "Add an `is_running` method to `_WorkflowInstanceImpl`, potentially returning `True` if a Runtime is defined or `not self._deleting`.",
  "workaround": "Move external service calls (like Kafka) to activities instead of workflows, ensuring deterministic workflow behavior.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The maintainers decided that implementing `is_running()` would mask incorrect usage patterns where users try to use non-deterministic external I/O in workflows. The error provides beneficial detection of illegal event loop usage.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "I'm actually kind of glad this raised a not-implemented so it catches illegal things happening to the workflow's event loop, such as code based on whether it's \"running\" or not as if it was a local event loop.",
