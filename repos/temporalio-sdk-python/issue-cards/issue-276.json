  "userImpact": "Users cannot use Python's standard logging `extra` parameter with workflow and activity loggers without encountering KeyError exceptions.",
  "rootCause": "The LoggerAdapter's process() method was not properly merging extra attributes from both the adapter instance and the log call, causing extra data to be lost in the logging context.",
  "proposedFix": "Support a merge_extra parameter in the LoggerAdapter initializer to control whether to merge adapter-level extra attributes with call-level extra attributes, similar to Python 3.13's implementation. For older Python versions, document subclassing as the recommended approach.",
  "workaround": "Subclass the LoggerAdapter and override the process() method to manually merge extra attributes as needed.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed by removing the super call in process() method (PR #280), then later addressed the merge_extra concern by documenting subclassing approach (issue #892).",
