  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily reconstruct and log stack traces from Temporal failures, requiring manual workarounds to append stack information to exception messages.",
  "rootCause": "Python SDK does not deserialize stack trace strings from Temporal failures back into traceback objects like the Java SDK does.",
  "proposedFix": "Parse stack trace strings using a library like python-tblib to reconstruct traceback objects, similar to Java's implementation.",
  "workaround": "Use a helper function to append stack traces to exception args when formatting logs, as demonstrated in comment #4.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "After investigation, the team decided not to deserialize tracebacks due to Python's traceback immutability constraints. Instead, users can opt-in to appending stack traces to exception messages using a custom helper function.",
