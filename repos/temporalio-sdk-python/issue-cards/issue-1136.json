  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly trace and monitor OpenAI agent execution within Temporal workflows, blocking observability for production multi-tenant applications.",
  "rootCause": "Plugin-based agent execution creates context isolation issues with OpenTelemetry instrumentation; logfire's TracingProvider overrides conflict with Temporal's tracing setup, and context variables created in different contexts cause detachment failures.",

  "workaround": "Use OpenAIAgentsInstrumentor().instrument() which provides traces but generates context detachment errors; or use logfire.instrument_openai() for partial tracing with null input/output.",
