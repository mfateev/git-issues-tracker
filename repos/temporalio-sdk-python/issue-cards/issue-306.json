  "rootCause": "Native Rust bridge module (temporal_sdk_bridge) is not built during standard poetry install; requires poe build-develop and recursive git clone.",
  "proposedFix": "Improve documentation to clarify that poe build-develop must be run after poetry install for SDK development, and that repo must be cloned recursively.",
  "workaround": "Run 'poe build-develop' and ensure repo is cloned with --recursive flag.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
