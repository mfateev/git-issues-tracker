  "userImpact": "Users attempting to use pathlib or other restricted modules in workflows receive errors and need to understand workarounds or disable sandboxing.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow sandbox restricts access to pathlib.Path methods to enforce deterministic workflow execution, as disk-based operations are non-deterministic.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Use `@workflow.defn(sandboxed=False)` to disable sandboxing entirely, or use `temporalio.workflow.unsafe.sandbox_unrestricted()` context manager for specific operations.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as a question rather than a bug. The behavior is intentional - sandboxing prevents non-deterministic disk access. Workarounds and documentation references were provided.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "You can use temporalio.workflow.unsafe.sandbox_unrestricted() for specific operations, but disk-based calls from inside workflows are strongly discouraged.",
