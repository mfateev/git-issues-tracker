  "summary": "In Python 3.13, using isinstance() with typing.Literal in the converter.py value_to_type function raises TypeError because subscripted generics cannot be used with class and instance checks. The function attempts isinstance(key, key_type) where key_type is typing.Literal, failing on dict conversions with Literal-typed keys.",
