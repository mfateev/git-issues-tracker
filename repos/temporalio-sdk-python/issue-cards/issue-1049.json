  "summary": "Feature request to enable custom metric support for activities running in multi-processed workers. Currently metrics cannot be accessed in child processes; the proposal is to forward metrics from child processes to the parent worker via a queue, similar to how heartbeating is handled.",

  "userImpact": "Users must manually configure complex OTEL tooling and metric aggregation to support metrics in multi-processed workers, adding significant complexity to projects using CPU-bound workloads.",
  "rootCause": "Metrics cannot be shared across process boundaries; the SDK currently lacks inter-process metric forwarding infrastructure for multi-processed workers.",
  "proposedFix": "Create an alternate MetricMeter implementation that queues metric actions to the parent process, which forwards them to the actual MetricMeter, similar to the existing heartbeat manager approach.",
  "workaround": "Set up a separate OTEL metrics toolchain with manual process ID tagging and external metric aggregation via OTEL collector's transform processor.",
