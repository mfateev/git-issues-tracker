  "userImpact": "Developers cannot debug workflows using VSCode debugger without manually disabling the sandbox, significantly impacting developer productivity during debugging sessions.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow sandbox's custom module loader (__getitem__ in _importer.py) doesn't provide access to standard library modules like 'warnings' that debugpy requires, causing KeyError when debugger tries to access sys.modules['warnings'].",
  "proposedFix": "Allow debugpy's _pydevd_bundle module to bypass sandbox restrictions or make standard library modules accessible through the sandbox's import system.",
  "workaround": "Disable the sandbox by using UnsandboxedWorkflowRunner() or SandboxedWorkflowRunner with explicit passthrough for _pydevd_bundle module, optionally setting debug_mode=True to avoid deadlock timeouts.",
