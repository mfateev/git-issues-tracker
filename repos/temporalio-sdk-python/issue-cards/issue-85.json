  "summary": "Python SDK required Rust installation for pip installation on unsupported platforms, complicating deployment. The issue was resolved by publishing pre-built wheels for common platforms (Windows x64, macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64) so Rust is only needed for rare environments.",

  "userImpact": "Users without Rust installed cannot easily deploy the Python SDK without building from source.",
  "rootCause": "The Python SDK wraps a Rust core (temporalio/bridge) that requires compilation when pre-built wheels are unavailable for the target platform.",
  "proposedFix": "Publish pre-built wheels for common platforms (Windows x64, macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64 with libc >= 2.17) to eliminate Rust dependency for most users.",
  "workaround": "Use pre-built wheels from GitHub Actions artifacts or build from source if Rust is available.",

  "keyQuote": "Our goal is to _not_ require Rust in any way to install. Our last alpha release only had a limited number of wheels pre-built",
