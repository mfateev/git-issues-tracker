  "summary": "User requests the ability to execute Workflow code directly outside of a Temporal Worker to avoid duplicating orchestration logic. Currently, calling workflow methods directly throws a NotInWorkflowEventLoopError because workflow primitives like execute_activity only work in a worker-based durable environment.",

  "userImpact": "Users who want to reuse workflow orchestration logic outside a Temporal Worker must duplicate code or create custom abstractions.",
  "rootCause": "Workflow primitives are designed exclusively for durable execution within a Temporal server context and require a specially-crafted deterministic event loop.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a user-level abstraction that checks workflow.in_workflow() to fall back to non-durable execution when outside a worker context, or implement manual retry logic.",
  "workaround": "Use workflow.in_workflow() checks to branch code paths between durable (workflow) and non-durable (standard async) execution; keep a registry of available activities for programmatic access.",
