  "userImpact": "Clients cannot distinguish between update failures due to workflow completion versus workflow cancellation, making it harder to implement proper error handling and retry logic.",
  "rootCause": "Workflow cancellation logic does not propagate cancellation signals to in-progress handler executions, allowing handlers to continue or fail with generic completion errors.",
  "proposedFix": "Update handler executions should be canceled when the workflow is canceled, with clients receiving a cancellation-specific exception. For signal handlers, use an SDK workflow logic flag to maintain backwards compatibility.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implementation added cancellation handling for update handlers with cancellation-specific exceptions, and a workflow logic flag for signal handler cancellation compatibility.",

  "keyQuote": "the client waiting on the update gets an exception, but the exception is `workflow execution already completed`. This ticket calls for that exception to inform the client that the update was canceled due to cancellation of the workflow.",
