  "summary": "User requests activity-specific worker tuning to control concurrency per activity type rather than globally, allowing better rate limit management for activities calling external APIs. The current WorkerTuner only supports per-task-queue tuning, which requires deploying separate workers for each activity type.",

  "userImpact": "Users managing rate-limited external API activities must deploy separate workers for each activity type, increasing operational complexity and DevOps overhead.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal distributes work at the task queue level, not activity name level, so slots cannot be reserved per-activity. Concurrency control mechanisms (WorkerTuner, slots) operate at task queue granularity.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement activity-specific slot allocation or expand WorkerTuner to support per-activity tuning configuration.",
  "workaround": "Use separate task queues (separate workers) for activities needing independent concurrency limits, or implement a mutex workflow pattern to gate activity scheduling.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer explained that Temporal's architecture distributes work at task queue level, not activity level. Recommended using separate task queues or mutex workflows instead.",
