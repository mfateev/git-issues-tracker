  "summary": "Feature request to support disabling TLS host verification in the Python SDK to enable testing with self-signed certificates. Users need this capability to connect to Temporal clusters with generic self-generated TLS certificates, similar to functionality available in other SDKs and the CLI.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot use self-signed certificates for testing against Temporal clusters without TLS host verification support, forcing workarounds or alternative deployment strategies.",
  "rootCause": "Python SDK's TlsConfig lacks a flag to disable hostname verification during certificate validation, unlike other Temporal SDKs which support this through environment variables or builder methods.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a hostname verification disable flag to the TlsConfig class that controls behavior in the rust SDK's client TLS configuration layer.",
  "workaround": "Set TlsConfig.domain to match the expected domain from the server's certificate instead of relying on the connection hostname.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Host verification disable option was implemented in TlsConfig",
  "related": [

  ],
  "keyQuote": "You should be able to set `TlsConfig.domain` as an expected domain from the cert the server uses instead of it default to the given host",
