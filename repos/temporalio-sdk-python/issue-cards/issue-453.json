  "userImpact": "Users with nested package structures cannot import workflows if parent packages contain non-deterministic code, forcing them to disable the sandbox or restructure their code.",
  "rootCause": "Python's import specification requires parent package __init__.py files to be executed when importing submodules. The SDK uses standard importlib behavior, which follows this specification.",
