  "userImpact": "Users cannot stream intermediate results from long-running activities, limiting use cases like batch processing with progress updates.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal architecture design: activities serialize results back to workflows as a single final value, with no intermediate result streaming mechanism.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement support for activities to yield intermediate results during execution, or provide examples of signaling patterns as an alternative.",
  "workaround": "Use signaling from the activity to the calling workflow via a Temporal client, combined with heartbeats on long-running activities.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Core Temporal limitation by design - activities return single serialized results. Maintainer suggested workaround using workflow signaling instead.",

  "keyQuote": "There is no concept of \"intermediate results\" in Temporal I am afraid. You'll have to rework your code if you need something different.",
