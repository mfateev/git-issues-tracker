  "userImpact": "Developers will receive warnings about unexpected runtime imports that consume memory and may indicate compatibility issues with third-party libraries.",
  "rootCause": "Third-party libraries sometimes perform lazy imports at runtime, which execute in the workflow sandbox where users cannot control them, causing unexpected memory overhead.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement opt-out warning for any imports after workflow file load, and opt-in strict mode with context manager `workflow.unsafe.imports_intentionally_reloaded()` to mark safe imports.",
