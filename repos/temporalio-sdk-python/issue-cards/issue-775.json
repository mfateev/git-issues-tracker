  "rootCause": "global_tags changed from applying to individual metrics to only updating OTEL resource/Prometheus target_info, causing regression from version 1.3 behavior.",
  "proposedFix": "Restore global_tags to apply tags to all emitted metrics as originally intended. Consider adding separate configuration options for OTEL resource attributes and metric-level labels to accommodate both use cases.",
