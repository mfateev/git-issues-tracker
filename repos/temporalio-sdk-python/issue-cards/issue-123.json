  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users are limited to proto 3.x and grpc 1.48.0+, preventing use of newer proto versions and potentially exposing them to known memory leaks in certain grpc versions.",
  "rootCause": "Current constraint to proto 3.x due to grpcio optional dependency requirements, and known memory leak in grpc versions >=1.43.0",
  "proposedFix": "Update dependency constraints to allow both proto 3.x and 4.x, potentially enabled by grpc PR 30382",
  "workaround": "Pin gRPC dependency to 1.41.0 which is known to be stable and free of memory leak issues",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by implementing support for proto 4.x alongside 3.x compatibility",
