  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users targeting Python 3.13 experience broken tracebacks and workflow sandbox access errors, while Python 3.8 support maintenance creates unnecessary burden.",
  "rootCause": "Python 3.13 changed traceback handling and introduced stricter sandbox restrictions that the current implementation doesn't account for; Python 3.8 is end-of-life and no longer warranted for support.",
  "proposedFix": "Follow the pattern established in #398 (PR #422) for dropping 3.7 and confirming 3.12 support; evaluate grpcio dependency compatibility with newer Python versions.",
  "workaround": "Revert to Python 3.12 to see actual error tracebacks instead of clobbered ones.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "3.13 support was implemented and included in a subsequent release; Python 3.8 support was dropped.",
