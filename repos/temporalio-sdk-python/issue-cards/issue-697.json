  "proposedFix": "Add cycle detection in DefaultFailureConverter to handle cases where e.__cause__ == e or generally truncate exception chains at a maximum depth (e.g., 10), similar to how deep stacks are truncated during serialization.",
  "workaround": "Avoid using 'raise e from e' pattern; reraise exceptions directly without specifying from clause, or manually reset e.__cause__ to None if it points to itself.",
