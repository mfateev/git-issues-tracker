  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably establish connections to self-hosted Temporal servers through proxies with authorization headers, causing worker failures and service unavailability.",
  "rootCause": "Proxy misconfiguration with improper timeout parameters (soft max connection age < 6m, hard max < 8m) causing connection interruption during long-lived gRPC calls that require 70+ seconds.",
  "proposedFix": "Configure proxy with proper parameters: allow calls for more than 80s, soft max connection age of no less than 6m, and hard max connection age of 8m to align with Temporal server expectations.",
  "workaround": "Reconfigure the proxy with appropriate timeout and connection age settings as per Temporal server requirements (70s, 5m, 6m10s).",
