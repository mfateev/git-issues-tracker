  "summary": "The Python SDK does not set the run ID in the UpdateHandle when receiving an update response, unlike other SDKs. This causes PollWorkflowUpdate requests to not be constrained to the specific run, potentially allowing polls to target different updates with the same ID in post-CAN or post-reset runs.",
