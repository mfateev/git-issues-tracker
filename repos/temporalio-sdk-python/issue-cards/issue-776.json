  "userImpact": "Users cannot use async logging libraries with thread executors inside workflows due to NotImplementedError.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow event loop is a custom deterministic loop with no thread capabilities by design to maintain determinism guarantees.",
  "proposedFix": "Use `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(my_async_call(), my_primary_loop).result()` or replace the base logger of `workflow.logger` with async-compatible equivalent.",
  "workaround": "Call asyncio operations from outside the deterministic loop; consider wrapping with `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` or use `workflow.logger` with modified base logger.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer clarified that implementing run_in_executor is not possible because the deterministic workflow loop intentionally excludes thread capabilities to preserve determinism. Recommended alternative approaches instead.",
