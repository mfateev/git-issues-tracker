  "userImpact": "Users must manually maintain an explicit list of all activity-decorated functions when registering them with workers, which is error-prone and violates separation of concerns.",
  "rootCause": "No public API or utility exists to programmatically discover activities by introspecting classes or modules.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide utility functions like get_activities_from_class(), get_activities_from_module(), and enhance Worker constructor to accept classes/modules directly for automatic activity extraction.",
  "workaround": "Users can manually wrap decorators or use AST parsing to discover activities, as shown in the issue and confirmed by multiple commenters who implemented similar solutions.",
