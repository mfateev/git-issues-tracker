  "summary": "Type checker Pyright incorrectly reports that activities imported via `workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()` should be strings rather than callable functions, breaking type checking for cross-file activity imports.",

  "userImpact": "Developers using Pyright get false type errors when importing activities through the sandbox import mechanism, reducing IDE support and type safety.",
  "rootCause": "Pyright's type inference fails to properly resolve the type of functions imported within a `workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()` context block, treating them as module types or unions instead of the actual function type.",

  "workaround": "Move activity imports to the same file as the workflow to bypass the sandbox import mechanism.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Determined to be a Pyright type checker limitation rather than an SDK bug. The SDK itself works correctly; the issue is in how Pyright handles type inference for imports within context managers.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "I think this may be a Pyright bug, because surrounding an import with something should not change its types from a static analysis perspective.",
