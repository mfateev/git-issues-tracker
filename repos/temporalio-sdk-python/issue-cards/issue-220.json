  "summary": "Using loguru library with temporal-sdk causes import errors in the workflow sandbox due to loguru extending restricted classes like datetime. The sandbox restrictions prevent loguru from loading properly during workflow initialization.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot use the loguru logging library in their Temporal SDK code without manually configuring passthrough modules.",
  "rootCause": "Loguru imports datetime internally and extends restricted classes, which triggers sandbox restrictions that prevent module loading during workflow preparation.",
  "proposedFix": "Mark loguru as a passthrough module using SandboxRestrictions with custom passthrough_modules configuration including loguru in the access set.",
  "workaround": "Add loguru to passthrough_modules in SandboxRestrictions.default before creating the Worker, using SandboxMatcher(access={\"loguru\"}).",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was resolved in a later release that made passthrough module configuration easier and more intuitive.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "This is due to a known issue with the sandbox when imports extend restricted classes like `datetime`. See the passthrough modules documentation.",
