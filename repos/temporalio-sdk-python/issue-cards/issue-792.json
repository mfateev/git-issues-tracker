  "summary": "wait_condition with timeout causes test to hang indefinitely instead of timing out, preventing workflows with signal timeouts from being properly tested. The issue was traced to a missing asyncio import and unregistered activities in the test, but highlights a broader problem with timeout exception handling in workflow testing.",

  "userImpact": "Developers cannot properly test workflows that use signal timeouts, making it impossible to verify timeout behavior in test suites.",
  "rootCause": "Test failures in workflow code (unregistered activities, missing imports) do not cause the workflow to fail by default, leaving wait_condition indefinitely suspended.",
  "proposedFix": "Set `workflow_failure_exception_types=[Exception]` worker option to make workflow failures from exceptions visible. Related issue #798 opened to allow timeouts to properly cause workflow failures.",
  "workaround": "Wrap wait_condition in try-except to catch TimeoutError and handle it explicitly; ensure all activities are registered and imports are correct in workflow code.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Issue resolved through debugging guidance; root cause identified as test setup issues. Related issue #798 tracks proper timeout failure handling.",
