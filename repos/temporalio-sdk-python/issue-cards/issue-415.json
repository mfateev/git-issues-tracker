  "summary": "Request to add an `in_workflow()` function to the Python SDK that allows code to detect if it's running within a workflow context, similar to Java's `isWorkflowThread()` and TypeScript's `inWorkflowContext()`. The implementer acknowledges this is not technically unsafe despite potentially being placed in an unsafe module.",
