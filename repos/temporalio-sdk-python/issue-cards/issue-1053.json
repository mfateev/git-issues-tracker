  "summary": "OTEL trace and span context propagation is missing for `execute_update_with_start_workflow` and `start_update_with_start_workflow` methods in the Python SDK. The methods were not included in the `_TracingClientOutboundInterceptor` after PR #702, causing trace context to be lost when invoking workflow updates with start.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot see complete distributed traces for workflow updates started with start_workflow because OTEL trace context is not propagated from the client through the update handler to activities.",
  "rootCause": "The `_TracingClientOutboundInterceptor` class in `temporalio/contrib/opentelemetry.py` was not updated to include methods for `execute_update_with_start_workflow` and `start_update_with_start_workflow` after PR #702 added these methods.",
  "proposedFix": "Add implementations of `execute_update_with_start_workflow` and `start_update_with_start_workflow` to `_TracingClientOutboundInterceptor` that wrap the calls with `_start_as_current_span()` to properly propagate trace context, similar to the pattern shown in the issue's patched version.",
  "workaround": "Users can subclass `_TracingClientOutboundInterceptor` and `TracingInterceptor` to manually add span wrapping for these methods, as demonstrated in the minimal reproduction.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The missing tracing interceptor methods were added to handle the new update-with-start-workflow operations.",

  "keyQuote": "start_update_with_start_workflow was not included in _TracingClientOutboundInterceptor after this PR. When I add it manually, propagation works as expected.",
