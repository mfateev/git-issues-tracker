  "summary": "Feature request to add an optional headers parameter to WorkflowHandle.signal() and Workflow.execute_update()/start_update() methods to allow passing custom workflow-level headers. The request was declined because Temporal headers are intentionally only set via interceptors for implicit setting and context propagation.",
