  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably use Python's string-based enums as activity parameters because the SDK incorrectly deserializes them, breaking type expectations and activity logic.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK's serialization logic does not properly handle string-based enums (class Status(str, Enum)), causing them to be deserialized as lists instead of strings or enum instances.",
  "proposedFix": "Add native support in the SDK to recognize and properly serialize/deserialize string-based enums, ensuring they maintain their type information during workflow execution.",
  "workaround": "Change activity signature to accept union types (Status | str) instead of just Status to work around the type mismatch.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The SDK was updated to properly handle string-based enum serialization and deserialization.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "This code prints `<class 'list'>` which can break your underlying activities.",
