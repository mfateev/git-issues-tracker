  "summary": "Add opt-in support for applying codec to headers in Python SDK. Currently headers bypass the codec, unlike in .NET and Ruby SDKs. This feature would allow non-search-attribute payloads to be processed through the codec, particularly needed for workflows where the data converter with codec isn't easily accessible.",
