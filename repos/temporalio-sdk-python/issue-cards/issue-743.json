  "summary": "ResourceBasedSlotOptions fields in the Python SDK documentation showed values between 0 and 1, but the underlying Rust implementation expected percentages between 0 and 100. This caused confusion and incorrect tuner behavior until the reporter realized the issue was insufficient container memory, not the value range itself.",
