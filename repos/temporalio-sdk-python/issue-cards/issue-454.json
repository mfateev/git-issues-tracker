  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly trace scheduled workflows because spans are created server-side (schedules) but client-side (workflows), breaking parent-child relationships across workers.",
  "rootCause": "Scheduled workflows are created server-side while spans are created client-side, preventing proper span hierarchy when workflows run on different workers.",
