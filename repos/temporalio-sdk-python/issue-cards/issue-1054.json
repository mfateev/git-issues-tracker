  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly trace activities started during workflow initialization, breaking distributed tracing visibility for initialization-time activity invocations.",
  "rootCause": "WorkflowOutboundInterceptor lacks a hook to wrap workflow `__init__` execution, so OpenTelemetry context is not captured and propagated when activities are started during initialization.",
  "proposedFix": "Introduce a hook in WorkflowOutboundInterceptor to wrap workflow `__init__` method execution, similar to how `run` is wrapped, to ensure context propagation.",
  "workaround": "Move activity invocations from `__init__` to the `run` method where context propagation works correctly.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "SDK maintainers recommended against starting substantial actions in workflow constructors, aligning with practices across other Temporal SDKs. Users should defer activity invocations to the `run` method.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "In most SDKs we have specifically disallowed taking substantial action inside of the workflow constructors. I would recommend you refrain from setting up commands inside `__init` and do so during `run` instead.",
