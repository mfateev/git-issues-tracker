  "summary": "The Python SDK's dataclass type hinting support is too limited. Currently only supports basic object conversion via dacite, but lacks support for collections, mappings, unions, and optionals. The team decided to implement a custom JSON deserializer based on pyserde that respects type hints without requiring decorators.",
