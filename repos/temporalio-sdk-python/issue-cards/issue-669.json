User requests native support for OTel logging and metrics in process-pool workers similar to existing OTel tracing support.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly use OpenTelemetry logging and metrics with process-pool workers, making it difficult to instrument sync activities and correlate observability data.",
  "rootCause": "OpenTelemetry logging and metric providers have known limitations with process-forking models similar to TracingProvider, but unlike TracingProvider, no workaround or native support has been implemented in the Temporal SDK.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement native support for OpenTelemetry logging and metrics in process-pool workers, or provide guidance on initialization patterns per-process/activity similar to how TracingProvider was handled.",
  "workaround": "User mentions initializing MeterProvider for each process/activity may be simpler than the global logger approach, but hasn't been fully tested.",
