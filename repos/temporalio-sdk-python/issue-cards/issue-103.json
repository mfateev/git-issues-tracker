  "summary": "Feature request to add `retry_policy` parameter to `continue_as_new()` so that retry policies can be carried over across workflow continuations. Currently, when a workflow continues as new, the server doesn't carry over retry policy settings, causing workflows to fail with `RetryPolicyNotSet` instead of respecting the original retry configuration.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot maintain consistent retry behavior across workflow continuations, leading to unexpected failures when workflows continue as new.",
  "rootCause": "The server doesn't carry over most parameters on continue_as_new requests; only explicitly specified parameters are used on the new workflow execution.",
  "proposedFix": "Add `retry_policy` parameter to the `continue_as_new()` method similar to how `search_attributes` is supported, with the long-term solution being for the temporal server to carry over workflow options by default.",
  "workaround": "Set retry_policy when calling start_workflow, but this only applies to the initial execution, not continuations.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue opened in sdk-core (referenced as #372) to implement in shared core code first, then implement in Python SDK.",
