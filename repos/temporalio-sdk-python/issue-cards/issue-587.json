  "summary": "Feature request to add `id_conflict_policy` argument to `execute_child_workflow()` for Python SDK, similar to the parameter recently added for other workflow start methods. The feature would reduce boilerplate try/except error handling when starting child workflows.",

  "userImpact": "Users must write manual try/except blocks with WorkflowAlreadyStartedError to handle ID conflicts in child workflows, adding complexity that could be simplified with the policy parameter.",
  "rootCause": "The `id_conflict_policy` parameter was added to the Temporal API but not yet exposed in the Python SDK's child workflow methods.",
  "proposedFix": "Add `id_conflict_policy` parameter to `execute_child_workflow()` and `start_child_workflow()` methods to match API capabilities.",
  "workaround": "Manually catch `WorkflowAlreadyStartedError` and use `get_external_workflow_handle()` to retrieve existing child workflow results, or store child handles on the workflow class.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers decided against adding this parameter, recommending explicit try/except handling as it's clearer for code readability and workflow history semantics.",

  "keyQuote": "We recommend using `WorkflowAlreadyStartedError` and consider it a healthy use of try/except. You can wrap it in a helper if needed.",
