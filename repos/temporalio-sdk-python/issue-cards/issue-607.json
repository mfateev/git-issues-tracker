  "userImpact": "Production deployments are at risk because running workflow processes can unexpectedly hot-reload code changes from disk, breaking user expectations that file modifications only take effect after process restart.",
  "rootCause": "Worker sandboxing implementation disables Python import cache, causing the workflow definition to be re-read from disk on every workflow run and CAN instead of being cached.",
  "proposedFix": "Permit the re-read-from-disk to continue but have the worker copy relevant files to a private location and import workflows from there instead of directly from the original location.",

  "keyQuote": "worker sandboxing involves disabling import cache which results in re-reading from disk... users are likely to expect that during deployments they can overwrite files without any modifications to running processes until process restart",
