  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot implement streaming agents that provide real-time progress updates to clients, blocking use cases that require incremental response feedback.",
  "rootCause": "Streaming updates from activities back to workflows require non-trivial implementation to propagate model outputs asynchronously during agent execution.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement streaming support in the OpenAI Agents plugin to handle run_streamed() calls and propagate updates back through the workflow.",
  "workaround": "Use two separate workers - one with the plugin for agent workflows and one without for regular workflows; or implement manual polling/callback mechanisms.",
  "resolution": null,
  "resolutionDetails": null,
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Streaming is not currently supported, as it is non-trivial to bring those updates back to the workflow from the activity in which the models are running.",
