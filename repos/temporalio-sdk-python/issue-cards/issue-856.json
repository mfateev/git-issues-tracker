  "userImpact": "Users struggle to consolidate Temporal SDK metrics with their FastAPI application metrics into a unified monitoring endpoint.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal metrics are emitted from Rust-based Core and appear on a different port/endpoint by default, not automatically integrated with FastAPI instrumentation.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a global `temporalio.runtime.Runtime` with telemetry config using `temporalio.runtime.MetricBuffer`, then repeatedly call `retrieve_updates` to get metric updates and expose them through the application's metrics endpoint.",
  "workaround": "Use an advanced metric buffer option in the Runtime telemetry configuration to manually retrieve and handle metrics.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as not an issue but rather a support question, with guidance provided on recommended approaches for metrics integration.",

  "keyQuote": "When creating the runtime, you can pass `telemetry` config that has `metrics` as a `temporalio.runtime.MetricBuffer` you create.",
