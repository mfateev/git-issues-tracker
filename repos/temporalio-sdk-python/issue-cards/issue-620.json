  "summary": "In Python SDK, workflow cancellation can be swallowed when an activity completes during the cancellation request, particularly with short-lived activities. The issue appears to be related to Python asyncio's behavior where cancellation can be lost if the awaited operation completes and swallows the cancellation signal.",
