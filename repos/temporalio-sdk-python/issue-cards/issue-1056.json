  "summary": "Add support for MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients in native Python workflows, enabling use of existing stdio and http transport MCP servers. Implementation should initially use activity calls with an activity-local worker for stateful sessions, with future versions supporting fully durable/fault-tolerant tool calls using nexus operations.",
