  "userImpact": "Users with third-party logging libraries like structlog cannot use advanced handler features due to sandbox restrictions and must find workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow sandbox prevents certain logging library operations (like json serialization and threadlocal imports) that advanced handlers require.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a `temporalio.workflow.logger.unsafe_disable_sandbox()` helper that wraps logger process calls in `sandbox_unrestricted()` and `imports_passed_through()` contexts, or provide a base `SandboxDisabledLoggerAdapter` class.",
  "workaround": "Users can manually create a custom LoggerAdapter that wraps the process method in `with temporalio.workflow.unsafe.sandbox_unrestricted()` and `with temporalio.workflow.unsafe.imports_passed_through()` contexts.",
