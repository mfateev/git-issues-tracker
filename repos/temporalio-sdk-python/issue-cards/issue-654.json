  "userImpact": "Users expecting multiprocess executor to distribute sequential activities across different worker processes find all activities running on the same process, defeating the purpose of multiprocessing.",
  "rootCause": "Multiprocess executor does not allocate new processes for sequential activity executions; it only distributes concurrent (parallel) activity executions across different processes.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Run activities concurrently using asyncio.create_task() instead of sequentially awaiting them, which allows the multiprocess executor to distribute them across different worker processes.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "This is not a bug but rather the expected behavior - multiprocess executor is designed to distribute concurrent activities across processes, not sequential ones. The user discovered the correct usage pattern through their own investigation.",
