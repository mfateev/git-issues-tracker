  "summary": "Feature request to make the Python SDK's 2-second deadlock detection timeout configurable per worker, similar to Go SDK's DeadlockDetectionTimeout option. Request was closed after team discussion concluded that workflows needing longer timeouts should use activities instead.",

  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot configure deadlock detection timeout in production and must restructure code or use debug mode for workflows with longer CPU-bound sections.",
  "rootCause": "Python SDK enforces a fixed 2-second deadlock detection timeout without configuration option, unlike Go SDK which allows customization.",
  "proposedFix": "Add deadlock_detection_timeout parameter to Worker class accepting timedelta, with default of 2 seconds and option to disable with None or 0.",
  "workaround": "Run workflows in debug_mode or set TEMPORAL_DEBUG environment variable to disable deadlock detection, or restructure long-running CPU-bound code into activities.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Team decided to keep the timeout fixed by design, as workflows legitimately needing longer timeouts should use activities instead of executing CPU-bound code in workflows.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "If you're doing things that extend the timeout beyond those values, there's a nearly 100% chance that you shouldn't be doing those things in a workflow context.",
