  "rootCause": "OpenTelemetry's Python SDK validates attribute types and removes non-basic types (dict, list) from attributes, as they don't match _VALID_ATTR_VALUE_TYPES, though nested maps are technically supported per the spec.",
  "proposedFix": "Add an option to flatten the logger's extra field by prefixing keys with 'temporal_activity.' and 'temporal_workflow.', or enhance temporalio.contrib.opentelemetry with a handler for nested extra data.",
  "workaround": "Disable default extra info (activity_info_on_extra = False, workflow_info_on_extra = False) and manually set logger extra fields using activity.info()._logger_details() or workflow.info()._logger_details() at the start of each activity/workflow. Alternatively, extend activity.LoggerAdapter and workflow.LoggerAdapter to override the process method.",
