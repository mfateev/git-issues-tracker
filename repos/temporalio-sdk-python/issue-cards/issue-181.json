  "userImpact": "Users with libraries depending on protobuf 3.x experience conflicts and cannot use the SDK until protobuf 3.x support is available.",
  "rootCause": "Mixed protobuf version dependencies across the ecosystem - some libraries upgraded to protobuf 4.x while others remain on 3.x, creating transitive dependency conflicts. Additionally, C static state sharing in protobuf 3.x can harm sandbox isolation.",
  "proposedFix": "Generate both proto 3.x and 4.x forms; modify initialization to dynamically import appropriate version based on installed protobuf; add CI testing for protobuf 3.x compatibility; investigate making 4.x default while maintaining 3.x compatibility.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was addressed by supporting protobuf 3.x compatibility through code generation strategies and CI validation.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Many libraries have not upgraded to 4.x while many have (including us). Depending on libraries that haven't is causing a problem for users.",
