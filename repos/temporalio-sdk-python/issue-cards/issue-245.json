  "summary": "When a worker process in ProcessPoolExecutor is terminated (e.g., segfault, OOMkill), the executor enters a BrokenProcessPool state that permanently disables activity execution. The worker cannot recover and continues failing all subsequent activities indefinitely.",

  "userImpact": "Users running synchronous activities with ProcessPoolExecutor cannot recover from worker process crashes, requiring manual worker restart and losing in-flight activities.",
  "rootCause": "ProcessPoolExecutor becomes permanently broken (BrokenProcessPool) when a worker process terminates, and the Temporal SDK does not handle this state by recovering the executor or failing the worker appropriately.",
  "proposedFix": "The Temporal Worker should fatally error and terminate when encountering a BrokenExecutor exception from run_in_executor, allowing orchestration systems (systemd, k8s) to restart the service.",
