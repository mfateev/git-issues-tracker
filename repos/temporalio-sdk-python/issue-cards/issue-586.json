  "summary": "User reported that `workflow.start_child_workflow()` throws `InvalidStateError` or blocks indefinitely in tests, while `workflow.execute_child_workflow()` works fine. The issue was resolved by clarifying that `ChildWorkflowHandle` is an `asyncio.Task` and should be awaited directly rather than calling `.result()`.",
