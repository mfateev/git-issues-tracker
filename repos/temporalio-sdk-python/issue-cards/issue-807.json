The Failure protobuf includes a stack_trace field that could be used to populate error tracking systems like Sentry with complete exception chains.",

  "rootCause": "Python exceptions don't support deserializing remote tracebacks from arbitrary strings (which can come from different languages/versions), and the Failure object's stack_trace field is not exposed through the exception chain.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose stack_trace from the failure object through the exception chain, or provide a utility function to collect stack traces from the failure object similar to the example code provided in comments.",
  "workaround": "Access raw failure object via FailureError.failure.stack_trace and manually construct stack trace information using utility functions.",

  "keyQuote": "The SDK already includes stack trace on the errors, it's just via `failure.stack_trace` instead of `__traceback__`",
