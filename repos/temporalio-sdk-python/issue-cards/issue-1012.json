  "userImpact": "Activities take significantly longer to retry (30 minutes) after worker process exits on second attempt instead of retrying immediately.",
  "rootCause": "Worker process exit is not automatically detected; the system waits for the full start_to_close_timeout before retrying rather than detecting the failure through heartbeat mechanism.",
  "proposedFix": "Add heartbeating to activities to enable automatic detection of worker failures, or implement automatic heartbeating feature.",

  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was not marked as a bug but rather identified as missing heartbeating in user's implementation. Recommended using the heartbeat mechanism for failure detection. Auto-heartbeating request tracked separately in features repo.",
