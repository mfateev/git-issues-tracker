  "userImpact": "Users with short-lived certificates can now update them without restarting their workers, improving operational flexibility in production environments.",
  "rootCause": "TLS configuration is set at client creation time with no mechanism to update certificates dynamically during runtime.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow users to replace the worker's client by setting the client property with a newly connected client that has refreshed TLS configuration.",
  "workaround": "Replace the worker's client property with a new client instance that has been connected with updated TLS configuration; the worker will use the new client for subsequent requests.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented client replacement capability via worker.client property setter, allowing dynamic client updates without stopping the worker.",

  "keyQuote": "You set the `client` property on the worker (which has a setter for `client` property) to replace the client with a newly connected client.",
