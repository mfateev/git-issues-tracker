  "userImpact": "PyCharm users experience incorrect IDE type checking warnings when calling signal() with no-argument signal handlers, though the code runs correctly.",
  "rootCause": "PyCharm's type inference doesn't recognize the existing Callable[SelfType, None] protocol as matching the no-argument signal pattern, while PyRight handles it correctly.",
  "proposedFix": "Add an overload to WorkflowHandle.signal() that explicitly accepts Callable[SelfType, None] parameters with optional rpc_metadata and rpc_timeout arguments.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer determined the proposed overload doesn't expand valid type ranges as Callable already fits MethodSyncOrAsyncNoParam protocol, suggesting this is a PyCharm bug rather than an SDK issue.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "That would indicate it is a PyCharm bug, not one for which we should introduce a new overload for all users.",
