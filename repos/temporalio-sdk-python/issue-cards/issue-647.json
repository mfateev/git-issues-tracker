  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot export OpenTelemetry metrics to HTTP-based services, limiting integration options and requiring workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "Python SDK's OpenTelemetry metrics exporter only implements OTLP/gRPC transport, not OTLP/HTTP like some other SDKs.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a simple boolean `http` option to `OpenTelemetryConfig` to enable HTTP transport, consistent with Go SDK support.",
  "workaround": "Deploy an OpenTelemetry collector (e.g., Grafana Alloy) to receive gRPC metrics and forward them to HTTP endpoints.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implementation in Rust Core layer (sdk-core #820) will provide HTTP support that can be applied to Python SDK.",

  "keyQuote": "Support for exporting OTel Metrics to services via OLTP/HTTP. This would bring the Python SDK up to parity with the Go SDK",
