  "summary": "Worker intermittently stops polling after completing long-running synchronous activities, causing a 5-15 minute delay before auto-reconnection. The gRPC connection drops after activity completion even though the CompleteActivity RPC succeeds, suggesting a race condition in the SDK's handling of synchronous activity completion.",
