  "userImpact": "Without runtime type validation, developers can pass incorrect types (e.g., integers instead of timedeltas) and receive cryptic errors instead of helpful guidance.",
  "rootCause": "RetryPolicy validation methods do not check parameter types at runtime, leading to unclear error messages when wrong types are passed.",
  "proposedFix": "Add type checks in validate methods to verify that timedelta parameters are actually timedelta objects, with clear error messages directing users to documentation.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers determined that runtime type checking for hundreds of parameters is unreasonable; Python type hints and static type checkers like MyPy are the intended solution.",

  "keyQuote": "I think it's a bit unreasonable to check the types of the hundreds of parameters/fields we have at runtime. We offer type hints and strongly encourage the use of MyPy or similar.",
