  "userImpact": "Users attempting to create helper functions for executing activities with certain retry policy configurations encounter task queue errors that don't occur without the helper wrapper.",
  "rootCause": "Unclear - appears to be related to retry policy configuration (initial_interval timing) affecting task queue resolution, but maintainer unable to reproduce consistently",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Use initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1) instead of larger values like 30 seconds in the retry policy",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was determined to be caused by user-side bugs in the reproduction case (wrong activity reference, invalid retry policy with maximum_interval < initial_interval). When corrected, the helper pattern works as expected.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "when I set initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=1), it works perfectly. But if I change it to initial_interval=timedelta(seconds=30), it throws an \"invalid TaskQueue\" error",
