  "summary": "When using LiteLLM with AWS Bedrock in the OpenAI agent SDK, rate limiting errors (503 Service Unavailable) are incorrectly classified as non-retryable instead of being retried. The issue is that the retry logic only checks for status code == 500, but should check for >= 500 like OpenAI's implementation does.",

  "userImpact": "Users leveraging LiteLLM with AWS Bedrock experience activity failures during rate limiting instead of automatic retries, breaking the reliability of AI agent workflows.",
  "rootCause": "Retry logic incorrectly uses == 500 comparison instead of >= 500 for HTTP status codes, causing 503 Service Unavailable errors to not trigger retries despite being defined as retryable by OpenAI.",
  "proposedFix": "Change the status code comparison from == 500 to >= 500 to match OpenAI's retry behavior and properly handle 503 and other 5xx errors.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Contributor acknowledged the bug was a straightforward fix - the inequality comparison was missed when mimicking OpenAI's retry policies.",

  "keyQuote": "your implementation does not correctly mimic the openAI retry policies. You only retry on 500 errors while the openAI code retries on >= 500",
