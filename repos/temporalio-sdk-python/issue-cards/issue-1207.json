  "userImpact": "Users must implement complex workarounds to expose workflow failure reasons and current state to client applications for UI display or decision-making.",
  "rootCause": "No direct API method exists to query current workflow state and failure details from the client; users must use queries or inspect history.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Use `upsert_memo` inside the workflow and `handle.describe().memo()` on the client side to share state information.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The SDK team clarified that failure/success is only available via result or history, and recommended using custom queries. A related server-side feature (temporal/temporal#8608) was opened to provide this info on describe.",

  "keyQuote": "You can write your own query that can return anything you want too and it can be called even after a workflow is closed.",
