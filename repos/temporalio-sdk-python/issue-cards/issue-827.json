  "userImpact": "Users cannot use FastAPI with uvicorn in the same codebase as Temporal workflows without restructuring their code.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow sandbox restricts access to gettext.gettext.__call__, which is called during uvicorn's module initialization. uvicorn's use of click.Path causes click to call gettext for localization, triggering the restriction.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Mark the uvicorn import as pass-through in the workflow sandbox configuration to prevent it from being sandboxed.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Added uvicorn to the list of pass-through modules in the workflow sandbox importer so it bypasses determinism restrictions.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Cannot access gettext.gettext.__call__ from inside a workflow. If this is code from a module not used in a workflow or known to only be used deterministically from a workflow, mark the import as pass through.",
