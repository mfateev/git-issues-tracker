  "summary": "Python 3.11's enhanced traceback information (code lines and position markers) significantly increases failure payload sizes, potentially exceeding server limits. The feature request asks for a way to disable this extra traceback data, though research determined the setting is global and users can use environment variables to disable it.",

  "userImpact": "Users running Python 3.11+ may experience failures that exceed server-side payload size limits due to enhanced traceback information.",
  "rootCause": "Python 3.11's PEP 657 adds code context and position markers (`^` and `~`) to tracebacks, increasing payload size.",
  "proposedFix": "Either provide opt-in/opt-out behavior to strip enhanced traceback data, or manually walk frames to build custom stack traces.",
  "workaround": "Set PYTHONNODEBUGRANGES environment variable or use -X no_debug_ranges command-line argument to disable debug ranges.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "After investigation, the enhanced traceback markers don't contribute significantly to size. Closing as won't do, recommending users use the environment variable workaround.",
