  "rootCause": "asyncio.gather() with return_exceptions=False (default) propagates the first exception immediately, causing the workflow to complete and cancel all outstanding activities per Temporal server behavior.",
  "proposedFix": "Use asyncio.gather() with return_exceptions=True to handle exceptions individually and allow other activities to complete before the workflow fails.",
  "workaround": "Set return_exceptions=True in asyncio.gather() to allow activities to fail individually without cancelling the entire workflow.",
