  "userImpact": "Users cannot use modern PEP 604 style optionals (X | Y syntax) in their Temporal workflows, forcing them to use older Union[X, Y] syntax.",
  "rootCause": "The converter.py code only checks for Union type origin but not for types.UnionType introduced in Python 3.10 for the | operator syntax.",
