  "userImpact": "Activities cannot access the retry policy configuration to make intelligent decisions about error reporting and observability without manual parameter passing.",
  "rootCause": "The protobuf definition for activity_task does not expose the retry policy, and the SDK intentionally does not provide this in ActivityInfo to maintain consistency across other SDKs.",
  "proposedFix": "Pass the desired retry attempt threshold as an activity parameter rather than exposing retry_policy in ActivityInfo. Use activity.info().attempt to implement conditional error handling.",
  "workaround": "Create a dataclass to pass the desired error reporting threshold (e.g., send_error_after_attempt) as an activity parameter, or handle error logging/observability in the workflow instead of the activity.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Design decision: retry_policy is intentionally not exposed in ActivityInfo. Other SDKs (Go, TypeScript, Java) also do not provide this. User should pass retry configuration as parameters to activities or handle observability at the workflow level.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "None of our SDKs provide the original retry policy via the activity info and Python shouldn't either.",
