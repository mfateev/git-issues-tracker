  "summary": "Refactor all Python SDK tests to use a test framework with multiple server forms instead of the current Go-based binary wrapper. This involves converting client/workflow tests to use injected test environments, updating activity tests, and running CI tests against both time-skipping and Temporalite test servers.",
