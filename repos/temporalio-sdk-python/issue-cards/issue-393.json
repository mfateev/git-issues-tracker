  "userImpact": "Users cannot see sub-exception tracebacks in the UI when ExceptionGroup is raised, making it harder to debug issues in parallel activities.",
  "rootCause": "The Temporal failure message protobuf only supports a single stack trace and cause, not multiple exceptions as needed for ExceptionGroup.",
  "proposedFix": "Discussed using traceback.format_exception instead of format_tb for ExceptionGroup specifically, but blocked by the failure message model limitation.",
  "workaround": "Users need to catch ExceptionGroup and re-raise as ApplicationError while logging the exception details manually.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "ExceptionGroup cannot be serialized to a Temporal failure (single stack trace, single cause model). Maintainers recommend handling via logs on the worker instead.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Exception group is not serializable to a Temporal failure which is a single message w/ a single stack trace and a single cause.",
