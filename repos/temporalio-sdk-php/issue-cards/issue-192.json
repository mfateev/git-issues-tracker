  "userImpact": "Developers cannot reliably cancel workflow coroutines containing timeout operations, as code continues executing after the timeout is cancelled.",
  "rootCause": "When restoring context after a cancelled timer, the code does not check whether the coroutine itself was cancelled before returning to it, allowing subsequent async tasks to execute.",
  "proposedFix": "Before entering a coroutine after cancelling a timer, check whether the coroutine is cancelled and skip execution if it is.",
  "workaround": "Replace `awaitWithTimeout()` with `await()` to avoid the issue, though this removes timeout functionality.",
