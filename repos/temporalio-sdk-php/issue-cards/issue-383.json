  "userImpact": "Users cannot create schedules without explicitly providing start and end times, limiting flexibility in schedule configuration and forcing workarounds like unsetting fields.",
  "rootCause": "The ScheduleSpec protobuf definition requires Timestamp fields that should be optional, causing validation errors when these fields are not provided during schedule creation.",
  "proposedFix": "Make startTime and endTime truly optional in the Schedule protobuf definition and handle null/unset values properly in the serialization layer.",
  "workaround": "Manually unset 'start_time' and 'end_time' keys in the ScheduleSpec constructor before calling parent::construct().",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was resolved by making the startTime and endTime fields properly optional in the protobuf schema and fixing the serialization handling.",
