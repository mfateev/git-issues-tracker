  "userImpact": "New users cannot effectively serialize data objects without external documentation or examples, and the lack of clarity between marshallers and DataConverters leads to confusion and workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "Marshaller documentation is completely missing from official PHP SDK documentation, and constructor promotion behavior differs from common serialization frameworks like Symfony Serializer.",
  "proposedFix": "Create comprehensive documentation explaining marshaller attributes (Marshal, MarshalArray, types), provide examples of usage, document DataConverter customization, clarify the difference between marshallers and DataConverters, and document the constructor promotion quirk.",
  "workaround": "Users can reference examples in samples-php repository or implement custom DataConverters, though this requires discovering these approaches independently.",
