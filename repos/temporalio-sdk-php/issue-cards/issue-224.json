  "summary": "SDK should support both lazy and eager connection modes for the Temporal client, with lazy connections avoiding server calls and eager connections validating connectivity. Additionally, expose a gRPC health check method for users who need it.",

  "userImpact": "Users can now choose between lazy connections (no server validation) and eager connections (with server validation) when creating Temporal clients, improving flexibility and reliability.",
  "rootCause": "PHP SDK lacked dual connection modes and health check capabilities available in other Temporal SDKs.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement lazy connection by default (PHP gRPC native behavior), add SystemInfoInterceptor for eager validation, and expose gRPC health service for client health checks.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented via SystemInfoInterceptor in v2.7.0 release which calls getSystemInfo() and getCapabilities() on first request, with option to disable by passing empty interceptor list.",

  "keyQuote": "In other languages we have a lazy method to create a connection (client) that doesn't make any calls to the server, and an eager connection method that fails if getSystemInfo fails.",
