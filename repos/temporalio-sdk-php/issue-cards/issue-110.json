  "userImpact": "Users migrating from legacy systems cannot gradually transition to Temporal attributes without reimplementing the entire WorkerFactory.",
  "rootCause": "WorkerFactory and related classes are declared as final, preventing subclassing and customization of the reader selection logic.",
  "proposedFix": "Add ReaderInterface as an optional parameter to WorkerFactory::create() method, similar to how DataConverterInterface is already handled. Make createReader() method protected or allow dependency injection via constructor.",
  "workaround": "Copy the entire WorkerFactory implementation to customize the reader selection logic.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was closed after the user agreed to submit a PR addressing the feature request.",

  "keyQuote": "The best option of course would be if I could override the default reader with my own through constructor, just like it's done with DataConverter currently.",
