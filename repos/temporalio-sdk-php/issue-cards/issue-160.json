  "userImpact": "Users cannot implement interruptible batch operations in workflows without understanding implicit yield behavior, leading to workflows that hang or complete unexpectedly.",
  "rootCause": "Missing yield keywords before Workflow::async() calls in certain contexts. The PHP SDK's implicit yield behavior for Workflow::async() in Promise::all() contexts differs from explicit yield requirements elsewhere, causing confusion about when yields are required.",
  "proposedFix": "Add explicit yield keywords before all Workflow::async() calls and clarify documentation about when yield is required versus implicit.",
  "workaround": "Wrap Promise::all() with Promise::any() and add explicit yield keywords before all Workflow::async() and Workflow::await() calls.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved as invalid/question - the issue was user misunderstanding of yield requirements in the PHP SDK. The workflow hangs due to missing yield keywords, not a bug in the SDK itself.",

  "keyQuote": "With `Workflow::await()` and `Workflow::await()` you just create promises. To actually execute the code inside you need to call `yield`.",
