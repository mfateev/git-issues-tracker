  "userImpact": "Users may misunderstand whether startUpdate is asynchronous or synchronous, leading to incorrect usage patterns and unexpected behavior in their workflows.",
  "rootCause": "The optional waitStage parameter and docstring phrasing ambiguously suggest asynchronous behavior when the operation is actually synchronous with respect to worker execution.",
  "proposedFix": "Make the waitStage parameter mandatory with clear flag values (ACCEPTED/COMPLETED) to force users to explicitly specify what they're awaiting, or add an explicit startUpdateAsync method in the future.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "In version 2.9.0, the method description was adjusted to clarify the synchronous nature. While the method signature wasn't changed to avoid breaking changes, clearer documentation now prevents user confusion.",
