  "rootCause": "Workflows require deterministic instantiation without constructor arguments to maintain replay consistency, creating tension with common DI patterns.",
  "proposedFix": "Use signals, activities, or local activities to pass configuration data into workflows deterministically, with local activities being the preferred long-term solution.",
  "workaround": "Load configuration via activity calls within the workflow, or use startWithSignal to inject config at workflow start time, or use side-effects for file-based config.",
