  "userImpact": "Users lack a standardized way to integrate Sentry for centralized error logging across activities and workflows, requiring manual try-catch and logging in each activity.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK does not provide a built-in global error handler or PSR-3 logger injection mechanism for activities, requiring users to implement error handling manually.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement container refactoring with activity call interception capability to catch exceptions globally, or make SDK properties protected for extension.",
  "workaround": "Intercept activity calls using a custom router (e.g., InvokeActivityRouter) or extend WorkerFactory, though this requires accessing private fields and is considered hacky.",

  "keyQuote": "The container refactor planned later this year, with some internal changes and optimizations, including the ability to intercept activity call (for exception catching or state resets).",
