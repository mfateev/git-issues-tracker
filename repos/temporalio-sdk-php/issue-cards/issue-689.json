  "userImpact": "Users cannot use `composer install --ignore-platform-reqs` to install the SDK without gRPC, and Laravel projects fail during package discovery due to runtime extension checks.",
  "rootCause": "The gRPC extension requirement is checked at runtime in BaseClient.php instead of being declared in composer.json as `ext-grpc`, violating composer best practices and causing issues with package discovery systems.",
  "proposedFix": "Add `\"ext-grpc\": \"*\"` to the `require` section of composer.json alongside existing extension requirements (`ext-curl`, `ext-json`).",
  "workaround": "Add `temporal/sdk` to Laravel's `dont-discover` array in composer.json, though this does not fully solve the problem.",
