  "summary": "Add a Workflow initialization method that's guaranteed to run before signals and updates, allowing handlers to access initialized values. The proposal is to implement a `getTypedInput()` method or constructor-based initialization to provide typed workflow arguments.",

  "userImpact": "Users can reliably initialize workflow state before signal/update handlers execute, improving code reliability and reducing boilerplate for type conversion.",
  "rootCause": "Current `getInput()` returns untyped ValuesInterface, requiring manual type specification and object recreation instead of reusing handler arguments.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement `Workflow::getTypedInput()` method to return typed arguments matching the Workflow Handler signature, possibly combined with constructor-based initialization via annotation.",
  "workaround": "Manually call `Workflow::getInput()->getValue(index, ClassName::class)` in constructor with explicit type specifications.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Workflow initialization feature implemented using `getTypedInput()` method approach in PHP SDK.",

  "keyQuote": "Add a new method `Workflow::getTypedInput()`, which will return the same arguments that will be sent to the Workflow Handler after initialization.",
