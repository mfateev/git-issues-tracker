  "userImpact": "Users cannot configure workers to listen to non-default namespaces, breaking multi-namespace deployments and requiring manual .rr.yaml configuration workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "PHP SDK WorkerOptions lacks namespace configuration support that exists in other SDKs like Go, requiring manual RoadRunner configuration instead.",
  "proposedFix": "Add namespace support to WorkerOptions similar to WorkflowClient, allowing workers to be configured with a specific namespace during creation.",
  "workaround": "Manually edit the .rr.yaml RoadRunner configuration file to set the namespace for workers.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Namespace support was included in v2.6.1 RoadRunner release, providing the necessary configuration capability in the generated .rr.yaml file.",
