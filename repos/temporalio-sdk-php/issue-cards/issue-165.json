  "userImpact": "Users cannot spawn child workflows with abandon policy and have parent workflows complete independently, preventing asynchronous child workflow patterns.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK implementation was blocking parent workflow completion until child workflow finished, contrary to the abandon parent close policy specification.",
  "proposedFix": "Fix the SDK to allow parent workflow to complete once child workflow has started (ChildWorkflowExecutionStarted event appears), rather than waiting for full child completion.",
  "workaround": "Use an activity with injected workflow client to spawn workflows from within activities instead of direct child workflow calls.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Bug was fixed in a subsequent release (mentioned in PR #167). Users need to update to latest SDK version where parent only waits for child to start.",
