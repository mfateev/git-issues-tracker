  "summary": "CarbonInterval::fromString() used for parsing DateInterval strings is too lenient and silently drops components (e.g., 'P2M' becomes 2 minutes instead of 2 months), causing unexpected behavior compared to PHP's DateInterval. Needs documentation clarification and potentially stricter parsing with warnings.",
