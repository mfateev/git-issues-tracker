  "summary": "Request to clarify the WorkflowClient API by distinguishing between Workflow Stub objects (typed interfaces) and Proxy objects (that implement user-defined Workflow interfaces). Currently, methods with 'Stub' postfix are inconsistent—some return WorkflowStubInterface while others return proxies, creating confusion and limiting access to stub functionality.",
