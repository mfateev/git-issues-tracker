  "rootCause": "Parent scope is incorrectly marked as cancelled when child async is cancelled, likely due to improper scope state management during cancellation propagation.",

  "workaround": "Starting an empty async after cancellation appears to reset scope state, allowing subsequent operations to work.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was resolved by implementing proper try-catch handling for cancelled child workflows; cancellation requires explicit exception handling in child scope.",
