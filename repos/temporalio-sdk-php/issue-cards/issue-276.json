  "userImpact": "Users cannot use custom data converters with encrypted payloads because workers fail to initialize when receiving encrypted workflow execution payloads.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK's worker initialization process does not respect or support custom data converters when decoding the initial workflow definition payload, only supporting known encodings like 'json/plain' and 'binary/plain'.",
  "proposedFix": "Modify the worker initialization logic to use the configured data converter when decoding payloads instead of only supporting hardcoded encodings.",
  "workaround": "Check for specific workflow initialization payload structure and skip encryption for those payloads while encrypting actual workflow input/output data.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was closed after discussion; likely resolved through implementation of custom converter support in worker initialization or documentation of the workaround pattern.",
