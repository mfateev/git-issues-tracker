The reason is simple: Any iterator is generic, i.e. a composite type.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to write in PHP:\r\n```php\r\npublic function getTransactionConfigs(): array<string, string>\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your case, there are two restrictions at the same time:\r\n1) The absence of the concept of a hash map in JSON (There are only objects)\r\n2) Inability to deduce an unambiguous type from return typehint.\r\n\r\nIn summary: Recommended to use DTOs to transfer composite data between code.\r\nSimilar question: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/93","createdAt":"2021-05-26T13:21:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/112#issuecomment-848764850","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0ODkyODM2Mw==","author":{"login":"Zylius"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ahh gotya!
