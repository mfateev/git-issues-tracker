Please describe.\n I was working on rollback strategies for the workflow after bad deployment. \nOne of the strategy is:\n\n```php\n  if(Workflow::getInfo()->binaryChecksum === \"checksum\" || Workflow::now() < $deploymentDateTime) {\n            // handle workflow code which are failing here\n            \n     } else {\n            // changes for new workflow\n    }\n```\n\nI would like this checksum to be associated with the worker. So whenever a worker is deployed, I would like to set its checksum to with the current git ref/commit. The way to do it is:  `worker.SetBinaryChecksum(\"commit-hash\") `. But I could not find anything with the current implementation of the worker to set its checksum. It would be a handy tool for rolling back deployments.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nI want to be to set the binary checksum with the worker using the SetBinaryChecksum method which is currently not present.\n\n","closedAt":"2025-12-26T15:11:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM5le2TH","author":{"login":"rustatian"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hey @manishrocksag 👋🏻 \r\nI guess you're looking for the Workflow Versioning: https://legacy-documentation-sdks.temporal.io/php/versioning, am I right?","createdAt":"2023-09-01T11:15:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/311#issuecomment-1702585543","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM7cHqZG","author":{"login":"xepozz"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Workflow Versioning perfectly solve this case.
