It's just an application, it doesn't scale (up or down) the PHP processes, and they are constant. Having this in mind, you may easily scale your pods with the RR inside.\r\nYou may use temporal and/or RR metrics to scale your cluster. For example: `queue_size` which indicates how many requests are waiting for the worker, or temporal metrics: https://docs.temporal.io/operation/how-to-tune-workers/","createdAt":"2022-05-26T18:28:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/178#issuecomment-1138885608","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM5D4g4U","author":{"login":"corelix"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@rustatian thank you!
