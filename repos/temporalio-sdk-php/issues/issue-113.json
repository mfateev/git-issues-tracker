First attempt, start parent workflow and it will start child workflow with workflow id\r\n2. Then the parent workflow will completed and child workflow will completed as expected\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-06-17 20-29-27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9275991/122406082-c6b3e380-cfaa-11eb-9b1a-445cab86d2d7.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-06-17 20-31-36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9275991/122406432-0aa6e880-cfab-11eb-8ad5-366f9b612183.png)\r\n\r\n3. Second attempt, start parent workflow and it will start child workflow with the same workflow id \r\n4. But the parent workflow status: Running, with StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed event because of START_CHILD_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_FAILED_CAUSE_WORKFLOW_ALREADY_EXISTS\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-06-17 20-30-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9275991/122406342-f9f67280-cfaa-11eb-87cb-4d759f467e83.png)\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-06-17 20-30-45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9275991/122406354-fb279f80-cfaa-11eb-9558-35b2fc71fcb1.png)\r\n5. Workflow instance will stuck at running, and the last event is WorkflowTaskCompleted until it timeout.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected to see workflow instance status is completed.\r\nBut the workflow instance status is running until it timeout.\r\nIf I do not catch the child workflow execution, then I expect that workflow instance status is failed.\r\n\r\n**Versions (please complete the following information where relevant):**\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n - Temporal Version: 1.9.2\r\n - are you using Docker or Kubernetes or building Temporal from source?
