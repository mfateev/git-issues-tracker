The `WorkflowExecutionDescription` class seems to provide the required data through its `info` property, but it is marked as `@internal`, making it inaccessible.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe `WorkflowExecutionDescription` class in the PHP SDK is marked as `@internal`, which prevents external usage. This restricts access to critical details about Workflow Execution, and there appears to be no alternative public API for retrieving this information.\n\n```php\nnamespace Temporal\\Client\\Workflow;\n\nuse Temporal\\Workflow\\WorkflowExecutionInfo;\n\n/**\n * DTO that contains detailed information about Workflow Execution.\n *\n * @see \\Temporal\\Api\\Workflowservice\\V1\\DescribeWorkflowExecutionResponse\n *\n * @internal\n */\nfinal class WorkflowExecutionDescription\n{\n    /**\n     * @internal\n     */\n    public function __construct(\n        public readonly WorkflowExecutionInfo $info,\n    ) {}\n}\n```\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\n- Temporal SDK Version: 2.13.4\n\n### Additional context\n\nI am specifically interested in retrieving the `WorkflowExecutionStatus` enum from the `WorkflowExecutionInfo $info` property within the `WorkflowExecutionDescription` class. This status is critical for my use case as it provides essential information about the current state of the Workflow Execution. Currently, the `@internal` annotation on the `WorkflowExecutionDescription` class prevents me from accessing this data. \n\nIs there an alternative way to obtain the `WorkflowExecutionStatus` without relying on the `WorkflowExecutionDescription` class? If no alternative exists, could the `@internal` annotation be removed or relaxed to allow external usage of this class?\n","closedAt":"2025-04-14T17:11:05Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM6nCD_s","author":{"login":"roxblnfk"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Feel free to use this property, I'll remove the annotation in the next minor release.","createdAt":"2025-04-14T17:01:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/598#issuecomment-2802335724","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-04-14T16:27:36Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzM5NDMzMTc0","name":"Bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":{"number":31,"title":"2.14.0","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":598,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Request to Remove @internal Annotation from WorkflowExecutionDescription or Provide Alternative Access","updatedAt":"2025-04-14T17:22:28Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/598"}
