Please describe.\r\n\r\nWe have older codebase where we have interfaces called UserExceptions and ApplicationExceptions based on this interfaces we know if error should be shown to user or not. Interfaces has also methods like getContext:array and getParameters:array which are similar to temporal failure details.\r\nWhen temporal activity fails we are not throwing temporal failures since our app is bit old and has hundreds of such exceptions. \r\n\r\nWhat SDK does is to call mapFailureToException and our context is lost here since it really just handles instance of temporal failures.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWould be great if ApplicationFailure was an interface this way we can just force our exceptions to implement this and create details and don't have to extend ApplicationFailure all the way.\r\n\r\nEvent something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface FailureWithDetails\r\n  public function getDetails(): ValuesInterface\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould probably solve the problem.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM5KSNZk","author":{"login":"zajca"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Or maybe interface like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface HasFailureInfo\r\n  public function getFailureInfo(): ApplicationFailureInfo\r\n```","createdAt":"2022-09-14T06:09:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/244#issuecomment-1246287460","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-09-14T06:07:31Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDMxNTY5NTYw","name":"enhancement","description":"","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":244,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] FailureConverter allow more context in ordinary exceptions","updatedAt":"2022-09-14T06:09:50Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/244"}
