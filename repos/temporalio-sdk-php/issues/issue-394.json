The samples documentation point out that gRPC PHP extension must be installed. When trying to instantiate a ServiceClient via `ServiceClient::create(...)` I got \"Class 'Grpc\\ChannelCredentials' not found\" as the extension wasn't available on my setup. Anyway I would have expected that a composer install would have failed because of the missing extension.\r\n\r\nWhen ext-grpc is a must have requirement I suggest adding it to the projects composer.json require section.","closedAt":"2024-03-07T18:33:05Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM5xyc9D","author":{"login":"roxblnfk"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hello.\r\nThe gRPC extension is only required for client calls.
