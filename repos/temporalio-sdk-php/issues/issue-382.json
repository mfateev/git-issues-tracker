This leads to even **class constructors** being included in the activity list.\n\n### Additional context\n\nDespite the fact that the documentation everywhere instructs the user to use attributes to mark activity methods, there is a chance that not everyone followed this. \nI propose to solve the problem in 2 stages:\n- [x] We will immediately remove constructors and other magic methods from scanning.\n- [ ] Add a FeatureFlag to disable the registration of activity methods without attributes.\n- [ ] We can trigger a DeprecationError to inform the user that they are calling an activity method that is not marked with an attribute.\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM7bMxa6","author":{"login":"xepozz"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Regarding the feature flag, why do you think it should be allowed at all?","createdAt":"2025-12-20T08:05:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/382#issuecomment-3677558458","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-01-05T14:14:35Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDMxNTY5NTYw","name":"enhancement","description":"","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":382,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Bug] Methods without ActivityMethod attribute are registered as Activities (even magic)","updatedAt":"2025-12-20T08:05:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/382"}
