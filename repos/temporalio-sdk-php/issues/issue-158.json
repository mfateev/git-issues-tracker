Where is `getClass()` coming from? The primitive PHP `ReflectionClass` doesn't have this method. Was `$class->getName()` the intended method, if one should be passing the fully qualified name of the class?\r\n\r\nI searched the codebase to rule out whether the instance of `ReflectionClass` being passed is actually a child class that implements `getClass()` but couldn't find such implementation, and if I missed it, then perhaps the docs should suggest using the child class instead of `ReflectionClass` to avoid any issues with the IDE which currently complains that `getClass()` doesn't exist.\r\n### Additional context\r\n```\r\n>>> $r = new \\ReflectionClass(\\App\\User::class)\r\n>>> $r->getClass()\r\nPHP Error:  Call to undefined method ReflectionClass::getClass() in Psy Shell code on line 1\r\n>>> $r->getName()\r\n=> \"App\\User\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"567\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-14 at 2 39 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5294918/163455495-cc0f8c92-69d4-46e6-ac71-2d2caa1e8434.png\">\r\n","closedAt":"2022-04-14T19:59:09Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM5BiiKI","author":{"login":"seregazhuk"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hi @the-invisible-man!
