So it's time to add a new `EnableEagerStart` option https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/releases/tag/v1.24.0\n\nFrom release notes:\n\n\n> Eager Workflow Dispatch (EWD) is a mechanism that minimizes the duration from starting a workflow to the processing of the first workflow task, making Temporal more suitable for latency sensitive applications. Eager workflow Dispatch can be enabled by setting EnableEagerStart in StartWorkflowOptions and if the server supports it and a local worker is available the task is fed directly to the worker.\n","closedAt":"2023-09-13T14:43:50Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM5k8W6W","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Note that this will require some extra work to allocate a workflow slot on a worker on the same task queue and delivering a workflow task to the workflow from the `StartWorfklowExecutionResponse`.","createdAt":"2023-08-25T15:29:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/344#issuecomment-1693544086","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-08-23T10:51:07Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDMxNTY5NTYw","name":"enhancement","description":"","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":2,"title":"2.6.0","description":"Requires Roadrunner 2023.3","dueOn":"2023-09-15T00:00:00Z"},"number":344,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] `EnableEagerStart` option in the  PHP `StartWorkflowOptions` structure","updatedAt":"2023-09-13T14:43:51Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/344"}
