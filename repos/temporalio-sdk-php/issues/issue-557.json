Please describe.\n\nFrom the documentation, it seems that workflow has the ability to specify memo notes (additional metadata) that could be used later in searches. I see in the PHP SDK the ability to populate a memo when workflow starts, but I don't see the ability to populate a memo during workflow execution.\n\nI have an order creation workflow where I have the order number appear. I would like to add it to the memo and then use it when investigating incidents.\n\nMaybe there's some other way?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI'd like something like this:\n\n```php\nWorkflow::addMemo('key', 'value');\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n[Memo documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows?_gl=1*1myspu0*_gcl_au*MTM2MTE4Mzc1NC4xNzMwOTkzNDA1*_ga*MTc3Njc3MTg3OS4xNzMwOTkzNDA2*_ga_R90Q9SJD3D*MTczODA3MTcwMC43LjEuMTczODA3MjMzOS4wLjAuMA..#memo)","closedAt":"2025-02-11T13:35:27Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEY5HBM6cIRMH","author":{"login":"roxblnfk"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> Maybe there's some other way?\n\n\n\nHi.
