Please describe.\r\n\r\nUsers use UUID a lot: generate like a side effect, pass in activities, get as results.\r\nRight now users must cast UUID objects to string manually.\r\n\r\nIt will be nice to support UUID objects in our marshaller.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe have the great UUID library (https://github.com/ramsey/uuid) in PHP world.\r\nThere is also `symfony/uid` but it is not a popular package yet.\r\n\r\nI think we can support the first or both in the SDK. We can do it in optional way - if a UUID library wasn't installed in the project then related typecaster will be deactivated.\r\n\r\n- [x] #345\r\n- [x] #346\r\n- [x] #350","closedAt":"2023-07-11T09:48:31Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-07-04T13:24:58Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MDMxNTY5NTYw","name":"enhancement","description":"","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":2,"title":"2.6.0","description":"Requires Roadrunner 2023.3","dueOn":"2023-09-15T00:00:00Z"},"number":317,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support UUID in marshaller","updatedAt":"2023-09-12T16:51:18Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/317"}
