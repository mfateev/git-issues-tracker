  "summary": "Users need visibility into workflow start delays when listing or describing workflows. Currently, WorkflowExecutionInfo doesn't expose when a workflow will actually begin execution if scheduled with a delay, making it unclear whether a workflow is truly running or waiting to start.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot determine if a workflow is delayed from startup or running normally, leading to confusion when workflows have scheduled start times.",
  "rootCause": "WorkflowExecutionInfo does not expose ExecutionTime (StartTime + StartDelay), which is needed to show users the actual scheduled execution time.",
  "proposedFix": "Add startDelay or ExecutionTime to WorkflowExecutionInfo, make it visible via DescribeWorkflowExecution and ListWorkflowExecutions (stored in memo for list), and surface it in CLI and UI displays.",
  "workaround": "ExecutionTime is already available in ListWorkflowExecutionsResponse and DescribeWorkflowExecutionResponse and can be accessed via JSON output: `temporal workflow list -o jsonl | jq`",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by surfacing ExecutionTime in the workflow page UI. ExecutionTime was already available in API responses but not exposed in the UI, causing confusion.",
