  "summary": "Reorganize the proto packages by decomposing the monolithic common and enums packages into specific purpose-driven packages. This improves code organization, eliminates enum naming conflicts and prefixes, and allows for better separation of concerns between shared API definitions and server-specific messages.",

  "userImpact": "Users will benefit from cleaner API namespaces, removal of enum prefixes in CLI and Web interfaces, and better alignment with protobuf v2 standards.",
  "rootCause": "Monolithic common and enums packages were designed to match Thrift layout for migration simplicity, but this creates poor naming practices, enum collisions, and locks the project to gogo compiler.",
