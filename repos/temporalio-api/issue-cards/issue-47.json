  "userImpact": "Users can now properly attach and retrieve failures in marker events without requiring custom serialization hacks or CLI workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "Recent changes to failure representation made it impractical to attach failures to markers without explicitly serializing to payload, requiring UI and CLI hacks for proper display.",
  "proposedFix": "Add explicit map<string, failure.Failure> failures field to MarkerRecordedEventAttributes and RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes, and change details to map<string, common.Payloads> for consistency.",
  "workaround": "Manually serialize failures to payload in marker events (requires explicit UI and CLI handling).",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented as proposed - added failures map field to marker event and decision attributes.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "After the recent change of how failures are represented it is not practically possible to attach a failure to the marker without explicitly serializing it to a payload.",
