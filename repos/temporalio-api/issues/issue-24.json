We definitely want to follow proto style guide. We are basically there with few upcoming changes:\r\n1. Add UNSPECIFIED to all enums,\r\n2. Convert all enum values to SCREAMING_CASE,\r\n3. Convert field names to snake_case.\r\n\r\nWe won't prefix enum values with enum type though. Actually I recently removed this prefix because we found it very unnice. Therefore, we won't be able to use DEFAULT rule set for `buf` but will have to add some excpetions.","createdAt":"2020-04-14T19:40:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/api/issues/24#issuecomment-613643050","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MzQ3MTU5MQ==","author":{"login":"alexshtin"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"```\r\n$ buf check lint | wc -l         \r\n0\r\n```","createdAt":"2020-06-12T20:32:51Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/api/issues/24#issuecomment-643471591","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-04-10T16:12:15Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":24,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Consider using buf for linting and clang-format for formatting","updatedAt":"2020-06-12T20:32:51Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/api/issues/24"}
