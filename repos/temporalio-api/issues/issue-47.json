It is not convenient and requires explicit UI and CLI hacks to show the Failure correctly.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to change the RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes and correspondent MarkerRecordedEventAttributes to include explicit map of Failure messages. Also, let's change details to a map as well to account for other possible uses. \r\n\r\n```protobuf\r\nmessage MarkerRecordedEventAttributes {\r\n    string markerName = 1;\r\n    map<string, common.Payloads> details = 2;\r\n    map<string, failure.Failure> failures = 3;\r\n    int64 decisionTaskCompletedEventId = 4;\r\n    common.Header header = 5;\r\n}\r\n```","closedAt":"2020-06-11T20:03:44Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-05-31T21:03:45Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":47,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add Failure to Marker decision and event","updatedAt":"2020-06-11T20:03:45Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/api/issues/47"}
