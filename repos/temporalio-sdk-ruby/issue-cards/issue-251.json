  "summary": "Add a way to disable implicit durable timers in Ruby SDK workflows, particularly for use with OpenTelemetry simple span processors that need non-durable timeouts. Implementation requires `Temporalio::Workflow::Unsafe.implicit_durable_timers_disabled` helper and integration with OTel span creation.",
