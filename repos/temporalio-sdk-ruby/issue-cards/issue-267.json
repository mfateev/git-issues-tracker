  "summary": "Rails lazy loading during development and testing causes IO errors in workflows because activity classes are lazily loaded, violating Temporal's no-IO-in-workflow constraint. Documentation is needed to clarify how to configure Rails to handle this safely, similar to existing Single-Table Inheritance guidance.",

  "userImpact": "Rails developers cannot easily test workflows during development/testing due to IO errors from lazy-loaded activity classes.",
  "rootCause": "Rails lazy loading by default during dev/test triggers activity class loading via bootsnap/zeitwerk, which performs file IO that violates Temporal's no-IO-in-workflow constraint.",
  "proposedFix": "Add documentation similar to Rails STI guide explaining how to configure eager loading or use Unsafe.illegal_call_tracing_disabled for Rails activity loading.",
  "workaround": "Can wrap lazy-loaded code in Temporalio::Workflow::Unsafe.illegal_call_tracing_disabled block to suppress IO restrictions.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Documentation added to clarify Rails lazy loading configuration for workflow testing.",

  "keyQuote": "Cannot access File path from inside a workflow. If this is known to be safe, the code can be run in a Temporalio::Workflow::Unsafe.illegal_call_tracing_disabled block.",
