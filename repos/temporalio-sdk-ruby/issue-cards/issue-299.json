  "userImpact": "Ruby developers cannot implement the same handler logic for different handler types with a shared name, forcing workarounds and reducing code reusability compared to other SDKs.",

  "proposedFix": "Modify the Ruby SDK handler registration mechanism to allow multiple handlers of different types to share the same name, matching the behavior of Python and other SDKs.",
  "workaround": "Use different names for each handler type (signal, update, query) even if they implement the same business logic.",
