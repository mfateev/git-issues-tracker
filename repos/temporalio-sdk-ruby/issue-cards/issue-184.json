  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users could benefit from better workflow state isolation through Ractor-based sandboxing, but the feature is blocked by ecosystem limitations.",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "It has been decided that while there are a lot of state-isolation benefits to Ractor-based workflows, since `Google::Protobuf` doesn't support them and since they are experimental, it is not worth the effort to require them today.",
