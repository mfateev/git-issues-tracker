  "summary": "Activity outbound heartbeat implementation incorrectly accesses the current activity context to get task token and activity info. This is problematic because heartbeat may be happening in a different thread/fiber, leading to potential race conditions or incorrect context access.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly implement heartbeating in activities that run on different threads/fibers, blocking production deployments.",
  "rootCause": "The heartbeat implementation uses `current` to access activity context, but this is unsafe when heartbeat executes on a different thread/fiber than the activity itself.",
  "proposedFix": "Task token should be provided through a different mechanism rather than accessing the current context during heartbeat.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was fixed and gem artifacts were prepared for release; users could build from source or wait for official release.",
