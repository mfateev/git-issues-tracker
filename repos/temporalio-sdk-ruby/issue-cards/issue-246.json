  "summary": "Feature request to evaluate explicit Rails integration/gem for the Ruby SDK, including Rails config/DI, code generation, ActiveJob integration, and ActiveModel/ActiveRecord support. After research and sample development, the team concluded there isn't enough substantial Rails-specific integration needed to justify an explicit gem beyond documentation and samples.",
