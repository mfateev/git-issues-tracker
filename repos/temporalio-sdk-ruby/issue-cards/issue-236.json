  "userImpact": "Users can implement saga patterns directly in their workflows using standard Temporal APIs rather than relying on a built-in utility.",
  "rootCause": "Saga is a pattern rather than a universal utility - different users need different compensation strategies (concurrent vs sequential, different error handling approaches).",
  "proposedFix": "Implement saga pattern manually in workflow code using activity sequencing and exception handling, as shown in the maintainer's example.",
  "workaround": "Use manual compensation activity sequencing with try-rescue blocks, as demonstrated in the maintainer's code example.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Not planned as a built-in utility because the pattern is already supported through standard SDK capabilities. Pattern will instead be demonstrated in samples.",
