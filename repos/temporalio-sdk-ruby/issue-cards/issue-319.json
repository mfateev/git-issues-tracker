  "summary": "Implement client-side trimming of failure proto to reduce server-side truncation and wrapping. The server currently truncates oversized failures and wraps them in error responses; this feature explores doing size limiting on the client before sending to prevent this behavior, with opt-out support for custom server limits.",
