  "userImpact": "Developers cannot effectively test signal-driven workflows in the Ruby SDK's time-skipping environment, forcing them to use real Temporal servers or alternative testing approaches.",
  "rootCause": "Time-skipping doesn't automatically progress workflows until `workflow_handle.result` is called; manual `sleep` on the environment is required to advance time after signals, but this behavior may not be clearly documented or intuitive.",
  "proposedFix": "Clarify documentation on time-skipping behavior with signals, or improve automatic time progression when signals are processed in test environments.",
  "workaround": "Call `sleep` on the environment to manually advance time after sending a signal; run `execute_workflow` in a background thread for automatic progression.",

  "keyQuote": "the automatic time-skipping doesn't kick in until you wait for the workflow result. So the workflow does not progress automatically until you wait for the result",
