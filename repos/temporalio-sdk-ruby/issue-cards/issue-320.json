  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users may experience unnecessary memory pressure and garbage collection overhead due to inefficient array operations in the fiber scheduler.",
  "rootCause": "Using array with repeated shift and append operations creates unnecessary memory churn instead of using a proper queue data structure.",
  "proposedFix": "Replace array-based ready fiber list with a queue data structure using non-blocking pop operations.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Author noted that while queue would be cleaner, the current implementation completely drains the array anyway, making the optimization not beneficial in practice.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Note, queue is a bit blocked on how it is used with our fiber scheduler. The way we completely drain this array means it's actually not a big deal here.",
