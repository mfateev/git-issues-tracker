Need a single-page form of list workflows.","closedAt":"2025-06-27T21:06:02Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM6y8ivq","author":{"login":"jeromepl"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I dug a bit into the internals of the coinbase temporal ruby gem and it looks like there an [`Executions` object](https://github.com/coinbase/temporal-ruby/blob/b5efd2cef802be2fa97d5bab04839413726ac06e/lib/temporal/workflow/executions.rb) is **always** returned. This object is an enumerable with `#next_page_token` and `#next_page` public methods, so very similar to what I proposed in #285.\n\nHowever what I don't like from the coinbase/temporal-ruby approach is that the return value of `#next_page_token` is ill-defined. If you call it _before_ calling `#each` you will get the token that was passed as input to get the list of workflows (or `nil` if none was given), but if you call it _after_ then you will get the token for the next page.\n\nThis leads me to think that we might not want to always return the same object type for `#list_workflows`, as in the case where no `page_size` is given, we would want to automatically traverse all pages and thus the what to return for `#next_page_token` while doing the traversal would be unclear.\nThis would leave us with two options:\n1. Have two possible return types for `#list_workflows`, depending on whether `page_size` is `nil` or not.\n2. Define a separate method for the \"paginated\" version of `#list_workflows`, for example `#list_workflows_paginated`.","createdAt":"2025-06-25T00:15:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/288#issuecomment-3002215402","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM6zKvqQ","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I think I personally like 2 and add a `list_workflow_page` w/ optional page size and next page token, and alter `list_workflows` to just use that (and make the interceptor and such for just the canonical `list_workflow_page`). The result of `list_workflow_page` can literally be `Temporalio::Client::ListWorkflowPage` that is a `Data` of the items and the next page token (with the absence representing completion).
