See if there's something we can do client side before the failure is sent to limit its size. Probably needs to be opt-out too since server-side failure size limits can be customizable for self-hosted users.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM6-imQL","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"See https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/597 for possible algorithm","createdAt":"2025-08-18T13:04:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/319#issuecomment-3196740619","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-08-15T19:29:05Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":319,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Look into client-side trimming of failures to avoid server-side wrap-and-truncate","updatedAt":"2025-08-18T13:04:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/319"}
