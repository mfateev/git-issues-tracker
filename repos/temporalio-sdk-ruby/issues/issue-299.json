Only one of these can be decorated with a specific name, unlike other SDKs where \"UpdateOrder\" is the name for all three\n    # Only one of these will work at a time, and do so by making its name 'UpdateOrder' as that's what the UI calls.\n    workflow_update(name: 'UpdateOrder')\n    def update_order_update(update_input)\n      logger.info(\"Received update order update with address: #{update_input['Address']}\")\n      @updated_address = update_input['Address']\n      \"Updated address: #{@updated_address}\"\n    end\n```\n\nThis results in the error message: \n\n> \"in `method_added': Workflow signal UpdateOrder already defined as a different handler type (RuntimeError)\"\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nSee previous section for how to replicate\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\nRuby SDK 0.4.0\n\n### Additional context\n\n\n","closedAt":"2025-08-21T21:32:24Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-21T19:37:49Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIE","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":299,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Workflow handler *name* can only be applied to one handler","updatedAt":"2025-08-21T21:32:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/299"}
