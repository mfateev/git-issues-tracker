Probably by running a workflow to completion that uses randomness to get some value into history twice (e.g. as two activities with random-built inputs), then reset the workflow between those two points and run it to completion. Then confirm the value pre-reset is the same but different post-reset.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-02-12T18:34:14Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":222,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Test randomness seed update over reset","updatedAt":"2025-02-12T18:34:14Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/222"}
