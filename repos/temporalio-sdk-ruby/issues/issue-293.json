It can cause clashes, if the same class name is used in different namespaces.\n\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/blob/v0.4.0/temporalio/lib/temporalio/workflow/definition.rb#L453\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/blob/v0.4.0/temporalio/lib/temporalio/activity/definition.rb#L89\n\nIt is counter-intuitive and may cause unexpected issues.\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nclass `Users::CreateWorkflow` -> workflow name becomes  `CreateWorkflow`\nclass `Accounts::CreateWorkflow` -> workflow name becomes  `CreateWorkflow`\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\nGem version 0.4.0\n\n### Workaround\n\nIt is possible to workaround the issue by specifying `workflow_name` in your workflow class or creating your own base classes like:\n\n```ruby\nclass ApplicationWorkflow <  Temporalio::Workflow::Definition\n  # explicitly set the workflow name to the class name including namespace to avoid collisions,\n  # because sdk drops namespace from the workflow name by default\n  def self.inherited(subclass)\n    subclass.workflow_name subclass.name.to_s\n    super\n  end\nend\n```\n\n```ruby\nclass ApplicationActivity <  Temporalio::Activity::Definition\n  # explicitly set the activity name to the class name including namespace to avoid collisions,\n  # because sdk drops namespace from the activity name by default\n  def self.inherited(subclass)\n    subclass.activity_name subclass.name.to_s\n    super\n  end\nend\n```\n\n\n","closedAt":"2025-07-01T13:44:58Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM60PqNO","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> It can cause clashes, if the same class name is used in different namespaces.\n\nUsing the unqualified class name by default is by design here and in other SDKs. This same ambiguity would happen if the same workflow type/function name were in different packages in Go, packages in Java, modules in Python, namespaces in .NET, etc. It is understood that in most Ruby contexts the fully qualified name is used to disambiguate even more than those other languages, but this default is chosen for SDK/CLI/UI compatibility/clarity. If you need to deviate from the default, you can use `activity_name`/`workflow_name`, e.g.\n\n```ruby\nclass ApplicationActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition\n  activity_name 'my-custom-name'\n\n  def execute\n    # ...\n  end\nend\n```","createdAt":"2025-07-01T13:22:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/293#issuecomment-3024003918","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM60P_aj","author":{"login":"laurynas"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@cretz thanks for the clarification!","createdAt":"2025-07-01T13:44:58Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/293#issuecomment-3024090787","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-07-01T13:18:55Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIE","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":293,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Do not drop namespace from activity/workflow name","updatedAt":"2025-07-01T13:44:58Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/293"}
