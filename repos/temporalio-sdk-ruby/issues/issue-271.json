We aren't going to use it by default but a custom converter may, so might as well","closedAt":"2025-07-14T13:02:30Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM6sTmSK","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"After some discussion, supporting `Struct` and `Data` types natively is fraught with complication on nested field types. If needed, it can be tackled later. Right now, just the ability to provide hints is good enough.","createdAt":"2025-05-19T12:24:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/271#issuecomment-2890818698","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-05-15T12:48:01Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":271,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Support \"hints\" for payload conversion","updatedAt":"2025-07-14T13:02:30Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/271"}
