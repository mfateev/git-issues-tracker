We are going to do the sample at https://github.com/temporalio/samples-ruby/issues/4 first, then apply learnings here. At this time, we think the following may be reasonable:\n\n* Code generation for creating a worker\n* ActiveModel/ActiveRecord support in converters\n* Rails context inside activities (maybe)\n\nTemporal client initializer is not really needed (can just create client yourself, will show in sample), and ActiveJob support is problematic because it expects the code to live on the Rails side instead of the worker side.
