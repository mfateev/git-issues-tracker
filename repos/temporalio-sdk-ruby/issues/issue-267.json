If this is known to be safe, the code can be run in a Temporalio::Workflow::Unsafe.illegal_call_tracing_disabled block.\n\nFrom `bootsnap` via `zeitwerk`. This is actually a good thing because potentially-side-effecting imports should not happen during workflow run. We need to document how to handle, similar to how https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v7.2/autoloading_and_reloading_constants.html#single-table-inheritance documents it.","closedAt":"2025-05-20T00:09:40Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-13T16:06:19Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":267,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Clarify in README issue with lazy loading during rails when testing workflows","updatedAt":"2025-05-20T00:09:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/267"}
