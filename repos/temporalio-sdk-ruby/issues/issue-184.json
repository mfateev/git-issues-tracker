But we have all these protos and impl in Rust, so it would not be _that_ hard to make a `method_missing` version of this (which is effectively what the existing Ruby extension does at https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/main/ruby/ext/google/protobuf_c), just effort and confirming we are ok abandoning the official proto library (which has other benefits such as not clashing with users' protobuf library use).","closedAt":"2025-01-21T21:05:41Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM6bUGk0","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"It has been decided that while there are a lot of state-isolation benefits to Ractor-based workflows, since `Google::Protobuf` doesn't support them and since they are experimental, it is not worth the effort to require them today.
