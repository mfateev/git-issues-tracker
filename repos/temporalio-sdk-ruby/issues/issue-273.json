But they can be created post-fork no problem. As part of this issue we should:\n\n* Confirm behavior with the Rails sample and fork-based server e.g. puma and make sure the sample still works with forking\n* Document that Temporal objects cannot be used across a fork (i.e. created before, accessed after)\n* Document that Temporal clients should not be used pre-fork since that by default creates a runtime (and possibly document how to provide an alternative runtime if a user must use a Temporal client on both sides of the fork)\n* Consider eagerly validating that a runtime and/or client is only used on the process it was created on (and raise exception with clear message if it is used across fork)","closedAt":"2025-07-23T18:37:20Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM64lR2m","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"After some thought, it is best that we store the process ID on the runtime and make sure every client call and every worker call are on the same PID as the runtime.","createdAt":"2025-07-21T13:23:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/273#issuecomment-3096780198","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-05-28T19:52:06Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":273,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Investigate, document, and validate fork behavior","updatedAt":"2025-07-23T18:37:20Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/273"}
