We have a large PR coming within the next few weeks for full workflow support that changes so much it may not be worth contributing at least until then. Are you looking to contribute the metric buffer implementation specifically? It is a bit advanced because it requires some specialized Rust side work.\r\n\r\nOverall it is a bit difficult to contribute at this early stage until we have a stable release. But we can probably use contribution to samples soon or in general just getting feedback from users on the SDK. Feel free to join us on #ruby-sdk on Slack (https://t.mp/slack) to give feedback or just discuss Ruby in general.","createdAt":"2024-12-19T13:00:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/176#issuecomment-2553835115","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-11-04T14:48:25Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":176,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Buffered metrics for user use","updatedAt":"2025-04-09T20:35:03Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/176"}
