We need the following methods on client:\r\n\r\n* `signal_with_start_workflow` - accepts signal, signal args, required `WithStartWorkflowOperation`, and returns workflow handle\r\n* `start_update_with_start_workflow` - accepts update, update args/options, required `WithStartWorkflowOperation`, and returns update handle\r\n* `execute_update_with_start_workflow` - accepts update, update args/options, required `WithStartWorkflowOperation`, and returns update result","closedAt":"2025-02-11T21:15:18Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-08T20:22:38Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":188,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Signal-with-start and update-with-start","updatedAt":"2025-02-11T21:15:18Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/188"}
