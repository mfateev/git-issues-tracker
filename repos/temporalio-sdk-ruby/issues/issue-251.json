So we need `Temporalio::Workflow::Unsafe.implicit_durable_timers_disabled` helper.\n\nTo test this, make sure simple span processor using OTLP exporter works (may also have to add `io_enabled` for OTel code).","closedAt":"2025-07-07T15:38:01Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-04-22T20:59:10Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHIK","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":251,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Allow implicit durable timers to be disabled","updatedAt":"2025-07-07T15:38:01Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/251"}
