Please describe.\n\nWhen a workflow fails, we don't have visibility outside the web UI. We use [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) for error notifications, and we want to send workflow errors to it. I searched the docs and couldn't find anything like that, I'm missing something?\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nMaybe a good solution would be adding an option to `Temporalio::Worker`, like\n\n```ruby\nworker = Temporalio::Worker.new(\n  ...\n  error_notifier: BugsnagNotifier\n)\n```\n\n`BugsnagNotifier` could be any class with an interface you define, like:\n\n```ruby\nclass BugsnagNotifier\n  def notify(exception)\n    # send exception to bugsnag\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWould you accept a PR for that? I can work on it if you provide me some guidance, since I'm not familiar with the sdk codebase 🙈 ","closedAt":"2025-08-04T14:22:35Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM67z3Kl","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"You should use interceptors for this which can wrap workflow logic. We don't yet have a good interceptors sample (we have https://github.com/temporalio/samples-ruby/tree/main/context_propagation which is a bit different, but I have opened https://github.com/temporalio/samples-ruby/issues/43). You may need to disable some things in the sandbox via `Temporalio::Workflow::Unsafe` calls to allow doing this illegal thing (accessing non-deterministic system like this in deterministic workflow). You can see how Python did it with Sentry at https://github.com/temporalio/samples-python/tree/main/sentry though the sample uses an older version of Sentry and is therefore a bit broken.\n\nFeel free to join us in the `#ruby-sdk` channel on [Slack](https://t.mp/slack) or in [our forums](https://community.temporal.io/) for general guidance discussion.
