When using MaxBytesHandler, the body of an HTTP request is not fully consumed. When the server attempts to read HTTP2 frames from the connection, it will instead be reading the body of the HTTP request, which could be attacker-manipulated to represent arbitrary HTTP2 requests.\n\n<p>Publish Date: 2023-01-13\n<p>URL: [CVE-2022-41721](https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-41721)</p>\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n### CVSS 3 Score Details (<b>7.5</b>)\n<p>\n\nBase Score Metrics:\n\n* Exploitability Metrics:\n  * Attack Vector: Network\n  * Attack Complexity: Low\n  * Privileges Required: None\n  * User Interaction: None\n  * Scope: Unchanged\n* Impact Metrics:\n  * Confidentiality Impact: None\n  * Integrity Impact: None\n  * Availability Impact: High\n</p>\nFor more information on CVSS3 Scores, click [here](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0).\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n### Suggested Fix\n<p>\n\n<p>Type: Upgrade version</p>\n<p>Release Date: 2023-01-13</p>\n<p>Fix Resolution: v0.2.0</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n</details>\n\n","closedAt":"2024-07-12T14:12:13Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM5OVnWn","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":":heavy_check_mark: This issue was automatically closed by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) was either marked as ignored or it is no longer part of the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2022-11-14T19:49:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/51#issuecomment-1314289063","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM5Pfp8r","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":":information_source: This issue was automatically re-opened by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) has been detected in the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2022-12-01T12:31:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/51#issuecomment-1333698347","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM5R8DJk","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":":heavy_check_mark: This issue was automatically closed by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) was either marked as ignored or it is no longer part of the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2023-01-08T03:13:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/51#issuecomment-1374696036","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM5TWGkh","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":":information_source: This issue was automatically re-opened by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) has been detected in the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2023-01-20T12:16:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/51#issuecomment-1398303009","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOHI0NyM6EqRVN","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The SDK is undergoing a rewrite/refresh and this issue applied to a previous version and is no longer applicable","createdAt":"2024-07-12T14:12:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/51#issuecomment-2225673549","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-10-18T14:59:49Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOHI0NyM7vFHMC","name":"Mend: dependency security vulnerability","description":"Security vulnerability detected by WhiteSource","color":"d1260f"}],"milestone":null,"number":51,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"github.com/temporalio/temporalite-v0.1.1: 1 vulnerabilities (highest severity is: 7.5)","updatedAt":"2024-07-12T14:12:13Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/51"}
