  "summary": "A workaround environment variable `TEMPORAL_FEATURES_DISABLE_WORKFLOW_COMPLETION_CHECK` was introduced to bypass test failures in cloud where workflows appear to still be running according to ListWorkflow APIs even after they complete. This workaround needs to be removed by properly resolving the underlying stale data issue.",
