  "rootCause": "Generated Go API uses a custom patch that converts CONSTANT_CASE enum values to CamelCase, violating proto3 JSON spec. SDKs have custom conversion code to handle this non-standard format.",
  "proposedFix": "SDK replayers should support both hacked JSON output and valid proto JSON output. Eventually remove hacked JSON generation and revert custom conversion code in all SDKs.",
