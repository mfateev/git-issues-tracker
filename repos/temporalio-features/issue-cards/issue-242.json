  "userImpact": "Users can achieve lower latency for workflow starts by enabling eager task dispatch when a local worker is available to process tasks immediately.",
  "rootCause": "Standard workflow task dispatch requires two transactions and a matching step, adding latency between start call and task execution.",
  "proposedFix": "Add disableEagerExecution flag to WorkflowOptions (default false), implement WorkerFactory registration with WorkflowClient, add reserveWorkflowExecutor and WFTDispatchHandle to Worker, and enable Server to return eager task in start response.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented across all SDKs (Java, Go, TypeScript, Python, .NET) with server-side support already in place.",
