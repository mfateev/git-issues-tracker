  "userImpact": "SDKs must correctly implement workflow update handling to support this new feature across all Temporal SDKs, particularly ensuring deterministic replay behavior.",
  "rootCause": "SDKs need to ensure workflow function runs at least once during replay before processing updates to allow update handler registration, preventing false nondeterminism errors when replaying with canned histories.",
  "proposedFix": "SDKs should avoid lazy update handler registration; instead ensure workflow function executes first during replay to register handlers before processing update jobs in activation.",
