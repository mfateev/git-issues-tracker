  "summary": "Core SDKs need support for gRPC binary metadata keys (with `-bin` suffix) to allow passing bytes as RPC metadata values, matching native gRPC library capabilities. Currently, Core SDKs only support string values as ASCII headers, causing Tonic to fail when binary headers are attempted.",
