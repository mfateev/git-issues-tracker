  "summary": "Request to implement SAGA pattern helpers as a first-class SDK feature across all language SDKs. While SAGAs are implementable from scratch, adding native support would signal platform capability and provide standardized, safer abstractions for distributed transactions.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users implementing distributed transactions would benefit from a standardized SAGA abstraction rather than implementing custom solutions for each use case.",
  "rootCause": "Lack of native SAGA support despite it being a core use case; existing implementations are minimal and incomplete without proper design and abstraction.",
  "proposedFix": "Design and implement a more full-featured SAGA abstraction that covers synchronous and asynchronous scenarios with proper server-side optimizations and best practices guidance.",
  "workaround": "Users can implement SAGAs from scratch using child workflows, signals, and compensating actions as shown in existing samples.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Team decided against implementing SAGAs as top-level SDK APIs after discussion. Good documentation and blog posts on compensating actions and SAGA patterns were created instead.",
