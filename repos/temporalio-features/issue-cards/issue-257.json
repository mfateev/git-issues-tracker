  "summary": "The Update API currently writes failure events to history even when external calls fail without workflow mutations, causing rapid history bloat. The request is to support a pattern where failed external calls don't generate history events, enabling scalable \"short update\" operations that act like RPCs.",

  "userImpact": "Without this feature, frequent update failures with external calls cause uncontrolled history growth that limits workflow scalability in production systems.",
  "rootCause": "Update API writes all failure events to history regardless of workflow state impact, and replaying to recover from cache invalidation causes significant service load.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow validators or pre-update local activities that execute without persisting history events; if they fail, no state changes occur; if they succeed, results pass to the update handler.",
  "workaround": "Users can call external systems before invoking the Update API and pass results directly, but this requires handling additional edge cases and race conditions.",

  "keyQuote": "this failure event will blow up the history very quickly. Hence this will become a scalability issue to use with Temporal.",
