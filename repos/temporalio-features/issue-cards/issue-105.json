  "userImpact": "Users with buggy activity implementations that don't heartbeat get delayed failures and retries instead of fast failures, leading to inefficient resource usage and longer error recovery times.",
  "rootCause": "Activities lack automatic timeout enforcement for missing heartbeats; the context is only cancelled when the activity attempts to heartbeat rather than at the configured timeout.",
  "proposedFix": "SDK should set a heartbeat timeout and cancel the activity context automatically if no heartbeat is received within the configured interval, allowing the activity to fail fast.",
