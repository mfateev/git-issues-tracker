  "summary": "Feature request to add support for dynamic (catch-all) handlers in all SDKs for workflows, activities, signals, queries, and updates. These handlers would be invoked when a specific handler isn't registered, allowing opt-in flexibility. Java already supports this; Go, TypeScript, Python, and .NET need implementation.",
