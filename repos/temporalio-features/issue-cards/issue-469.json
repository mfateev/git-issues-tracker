  "summary": "The start_update API is synchronous and blocks waiting for the remote worker to accept the update, which misleads users into thinking it's fully asynchronous like start_activity and start_workflow. Users should be forced to explicitly specify what stage they're waiting for (ACCEPTED or COMPLETED) to make the blocking behavior clear.",
