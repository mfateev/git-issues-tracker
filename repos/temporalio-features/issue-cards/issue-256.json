  "summary": "Feature request to include workflow input in the describe() response. Currently users must separately fetch history and decode payloads to get input parameters; the request proposes adding input as a decoded array to the describe() call response.",

  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users currently need to make multiple API calls and manual decoding to retrieve workflow input, making it harder to look up input based on workflow ID.",
  "rootCause": "The describe() API only returns execution metadata but not the input payloads, which are considered part of workflow history rather than basic execution information.",
  "proposedFix": "Either: (1) Have describe() call both DescribeWorkflow and fetch history to return input, or (2) Have the server add input field to DescribeWorkflowExecutionResponse",
  "workaround": "Call describe() and then separately fetch history and decode payloads manually",

  "keyQuote": "We offer users the ability to do describe and history fetch, we don't need to combine the calls for them.",
