  "summary": "The getVersion API is memoized by default to coordinate patches across code, but there's a request to add an opt-in non-memoized version option. TypeScript accidentally implemented non-memoized by default, which has benefits like being embeddable in loops, and this feature explores making that an official option across SDKs.",
