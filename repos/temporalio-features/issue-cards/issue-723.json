  "rootCause": "SDKs currently do not validate payload sizes before submission, causing entire requests to fail when limits are exceeded rather than failing the task gracefully.",
  "proposedFix": "SDKs should know the payload size limits and submit workflow task failures instead of completions with oversized payloads, allowing workflows to continue if updated.",

  "keyQuote": "If the SDK knows the error limits for payloads, it can submit a workflow task failure rather than submitting a completion that contains oversized payloads.",
