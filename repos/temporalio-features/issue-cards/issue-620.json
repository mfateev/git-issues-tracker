  "summary": "Feature request to implement activity reset support across all Temporal SDKs. When an activity is reset, it should restart from the beginning, with optional heartbeat clearing. The implementation should handle reset events similarly to pause and cancel operations, allowing users to write exception handlers that can differentiate between interruption types.",
