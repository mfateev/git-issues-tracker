  "userImpact": "Developers testing with local Temporal servers experience cluttered test logs from startup banners, making test output harder to read.",
  "rootCause": "The temporal CLI outputs a startup banner by default that cannot be suppressed, affecting all SDK tests using local server.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a switch or configuration option to suppress the startup banner in start_local or related functions.",
