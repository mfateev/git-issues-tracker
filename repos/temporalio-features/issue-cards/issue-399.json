  "rootCause": "The system lacks a mechanism for recording opaque marker events without the constraints of signals (which require actual workflow handling) or activities (which impact performance).",
  "proposedFix": "Add a way to record custom MarkerRecorded events that are opaque for the server, allowing developers to annotate workflow history with custom information.",
  "workaround": "Use queries to expose workflow-specific information, or use noop activities with payloads (though this impacts history growth and recovery time).",
