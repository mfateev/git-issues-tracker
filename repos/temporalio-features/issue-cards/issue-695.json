  "summary": "Add support for setting `GrpcMessageTooLarge` as a failure reason on the `temporal_workflow_task_execution_failed` metric when workflow tasks fail due to gRPC message size limits. This enhancement should help users identify and diagnose large message issues without significantly increasing metric cardinality.",
