  "summary": "SDK logic needs a standard versioning mechanism to handle history-incompatible behavior changes internally, similar to the existing getVersion and patched APIs available for user logic. The feature proposes adding fields to WorkflowTaskCompleted event and CompleteWorkflowTaskRequest proto messages to encode internal SDK versions without creating new history events.",
