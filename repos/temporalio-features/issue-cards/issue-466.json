  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users struggle to identify which handler executed in logs and cannot easily grep for specific update/signal/query invocations, complicating production debugging.",
  "rootCause": "SDK loggers do not include handler type and update ID in the logging context by default, requiring manual workarounds.",
  "proposedFix": "Add handler type and update ID to the logging context implicitly across all SDKs in a language-idiomatic way (e.g., contextvars in Python, scoped loggers in other languages).",
  "workaround": "Users can manually add handler information to logs using language-specific mechanisms like Python's `extra` parameter or creating custom logger adapters.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented across all SDKs to include handler context and update ID in logging.",

  "keyQuote": "I'd love if the context or prefix listed which handler it's in somehow and perhaps whether it was a signal/update/query. In the case of an update, I'd like to see the update ID.",
