  "summary": "SDKs currently return update handles even when the update hasn't reached the desired lifecycle stage, which is dangerous because updates aren't durable until accepted. The fix requires SDKs to poll the update request until it reaches the desired state before returning the handle to the user.",

  "rootCause": "SDKs pass the desired lifecycle stage option to gRPC but don't handle server internal timeouts that return empty responses, immediately returning a handle instead of polling.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Server-side support was merged to properly handle update lifecycle states and return specific errors for lost updates. SDKs implement polling logic per alexshtin's protocol.",
