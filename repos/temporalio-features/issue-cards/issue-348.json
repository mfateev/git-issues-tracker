  "userImpact": "Users needing programmatic access to admin operations like task refresh must use workarounds instead of a standardized SDK interface.",
  "rootCause": "AdminService is an internal server API not exposed through the official public API repository (temporalio/api), so SDKs cannot officially support it.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose refresh task API or other needed admin operations through the public Temporal API (temporalio/api repo) if the team decides to support them officially.",
  "workaround": "Users can generate gRPC client from protos directly, call temporal CLI programmatically, or for Go use 'import \"go.temporal.io/server/api/adminservice/v1\"' with a gRPC connection.",
