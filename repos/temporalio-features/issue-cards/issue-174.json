  "userImpact": "Users of Go and Python SDKs cannot configure activity options at the workflow or type level, forcing them to pass options at call sites or use workarounds like partial functions.",
  "rootCause": "Different SDK implementations have evolved with different approaches to activity option configuration; Go and Python SDKs lack the higher-level abstractions present in TypeScript and Java.",
  "proposedFix": "Consider adding workflow-level or type-level activity option support to Go and Python SDKs, potentially with a more generalized solution allowing definition-site configuration of workflow and activity options.",
  "workaround": "In Python, developers can use `partial` functions to bake options into activity functions, providing semantics similar to TypeScript and Java proxies.",
