  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently control heartbeat timing from activity start, leading to unnecessary billable heartbeat calls and delayed activity details reporting.",
  "rootCause": "Heartbeat throttling counter starts after the first heartbeat is sent rather than at activity start time, causing the first actual heartbeat to be sent immediately instead of at 4/5 of the timeout.",
  "proposedFix": "Treat activity start as the first heartbeat time so throttling delays begin from activity initialization. Alternatively, add a 'force heartbeat' flag to guarantee synchronous heartbeat calls without waiting for throttling delay.",
