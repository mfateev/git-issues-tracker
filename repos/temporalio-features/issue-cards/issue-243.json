  "userImpact": "Users currently must access schedule information through search attributes, which is difficult to discover and work with across different SDKs.",
  "rootCause": "Schedule-specific information is stored only as search attributes without a dedicated API, making it hard for users to access and requiring knowledge of internal implementation details.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose a separate API to return schedule information if the workflow was started by a schedule.",
  "workaround": "Use the deprecated GetInfo API to access search attributes directly, or use GetTypedSearchAttributes with SearchAttributeKeyTime from the temporal package.",
