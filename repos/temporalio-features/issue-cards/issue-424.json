  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently handle scenarios with many sequential or parallel local activities, forcing them to wait for workflow task timeout before processing queries or signals.",
  "rootCause": "Workflow tasks are designed to wait until 80% of the timeout before completing, which delays query and signal processing when multiple local activities are executed sequentially or in parallel.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a flag to LocalActivityOptions to force complete the workflow task when the local activity completes/fails, or provide an API like activity.forceCompleteWorkflowTask() for user code to invoke.",

  "keyQuote": "This will then make it possible to process query task, or new signals by letting user workflow decide when to report task completed and get a new workflow task.",
