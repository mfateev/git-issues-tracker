  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Workers cannot reliably notify activities of timeout expiration, increasing the risk of duplicate activity executions for sensitive workloads.",
  "rootCause": "SDKs lack worker-side timeout notification mechanism; only heartbeating provides timeout awareness, and SDK throttles heartbeats without notifying activity implementation.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement SDK-specific timeout notification mechanisms: Go should cancel the context, Java should throw from heartbeat method, and core-based SDKs should propagate via their cancellation mechanism. Respect all three timeout types (start-to-close, schedule-to-close, heartbeat).",
  "workaround": "Make activity implementations reentrant to handle potential duplicate executions, though this adds complexity for sensitive workloads.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Feature request was accepted with implementation guidance defined for each SDK. Decision made to respect all three timeout types without replying to server about timeout (since it should already be timed out server-side).",
