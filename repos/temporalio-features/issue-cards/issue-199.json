  "userImpact": "Users cannot apply custom data converters to stack trace queries, limiting consistency in how query data is serialized across different query types.",
  "rootCause": "Stack trace queries are handled specially and bypass the custom data converter pipeline to avoid complexity with remote encoders and proxies.",
