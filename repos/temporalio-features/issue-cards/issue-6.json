  "summary": "SDKs need to stop retrying on 'Internal' server errors and instead treat them as non-retryable, while continuing to retry 'Unavailable' errors. SDKs should use the capabilities reported in the getSystemInfo API to distinguish between server versions that properly differentiate these error codes.",

  "userImpact": "Without this fix, SDKs retry on Internal errors that shouldn't be retried, leading to unnecessary delays and potential cascading failures when the server encounters non-recoverable errors.",
  "rootCause": "Server previously returned only 'Internal' errors, so SDKs always retried them. Now server differentiates between 'Internal' (non-retryable) and 'Unavailable' (retryable), requiring SDK changes.",
  "proposedFix": "SDKs should use the capabilities reported in the getSystemInfo API call to determine if the server properly supports the Internal/Unavailable differentiation, and conditionally stop retrying Internal errors.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented across all SDKs: Go SDK, Core SDK, TypeScript SDK client, Java SDK (issue #1315), and PHP SDK (issue #221). Verified complete in all implementations.",
