  "summary": "SDKs should implement more aggressive backoff when encountering ResourceExhaustedError from the server, as continued retry attempts can worsen outages. The request is to add a custom retry policy with larger backoff intervals and smaller max attempt counts specifically for resource exhaustion scenarios.",

  "rootCause": "Current retry policy treats ResourceExhaustedError like other transient errors with insufficient backoff, causing aggressive retries that worsen server overload conditions.",
