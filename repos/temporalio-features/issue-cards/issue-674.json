  "summary": "TypeScript SDK needs to expose Temporal Nexus operation info (namespace and task queue) to Nexus operation authors, similar to how activity and workflow info are provided to their respective authors. This feature has been implemented in Go, Java, Python, and .NET SDKs but is still pending for TypeScript and Ruby/PHP (which don't have Nexus yet).",
