  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users dealing with bad deployments that break determinism can now identify workflow build versions and conditionally apply logic without versioning APIs.",
  "rootCause": "Build ID information stored on workflow task completions was not exposed to user code, forcing fallback to heuristics like start time when determinism breaks.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose build ID through WorkflowInfo API in all language SDKs, using naming convention like 'latest build ID' or 'most recent build ID'.",
  "workaround": "Users had to use start time or other heuristics to switch between old and new workflow logic, or terminate/reset workflows.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Build ID was exposed via WorkflowInfo in all SDK implementations (Java, Go, and other language SDKs).",

  "keyQuote": "Expose build ID via WorkflowInfo so that users can switch based on it and unblock both new and old workflows.",
