  "userImpact": "Users cannot gracefully shutdown workers with long-running activities without losing progress or implement single-slot polling for non-multi-tenant services.",
  "rootCause": "The activity poller lacks a configurable limit on concurrent polling tasks and doesn't support pausing after slot acquisition to enable graceful shutdown.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement MaximumPollTaskPerPoller configuration or add a PauseableSlotSupplier interface that pauses polling after acquiring a slot, with discussion of more sophisticated semantics like invalidating unused slots.",
  "workaround": "Shutdown the worker as the last action in an activity's finally block to stop polling before the slot is released.",

  "keyQuote": "It would be nice number of times an activity worker can poll tasks, as our service is currently not multi-tenant, and we would like to set it to 1.",
