  "rootCause": "Different SDKs have different implicit defaults and maximums for heartbeat throttling (Java: 30s max/0s default, Go: 10m default/no max), causing inconsistent behavior.",
  "proposedFix": "Add maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval (default 60s) and defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval (default 30s) WorkerOptions with formula: throttleInterval = min(heartbeat_timeout * 0.8 if provided else defaultHeartbeatThrottleInterval, maxHeartbeatThrottleInterval)",
