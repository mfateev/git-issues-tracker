  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users need compatible encryption implementations across SDKs to securely pass data between workflows in different languages.",
  "rootCause": "Different encryption implementations in TS and Go samples used different algorithms and approaches, making them incompatible with each other.",

  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The incompatibility was fixed by adjusting the TS crypto usage in a PR to make it compatible with the Go implementation, without needing to port all samples to nacl.",

  "keyQuote": "I'd recommend nacl-based encryption instead of AES-based encryption for cross-language compatibility for many reasons.",
