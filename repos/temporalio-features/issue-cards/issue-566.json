  "summary": "SDKs need to implement support for full query failure structure in the new `failure` field on query responses. Workers should set converted query failures while maintaining backward compatibility by keeping `error_message` aligned with `failure.message`. Clients should check for `QueryFailedFailure` gRPC details and set them as the cause of returned errors.",
