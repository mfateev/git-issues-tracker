  "userImpact": "Users of temporal-sdk-1.15.0 are exposed to high-severity security vulnerabilities that could lead to denial of service attacks through resource exhaustion.",
  "rootCause": "Outdated transitive dependencies: jackson-databind-2.13.1 lacks checks in deserialization to prevent deeply nested array exploitation, and protobuf-java-3.21.4 has parsing vulnerabilities.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade jackson-databind to 2.13.4.1 or later and protobuf-java to a patched version addressing CVE-2022-3509 and CVE-2022-3171.",
