  "rootCause": "workflow_endtoend_latency is calculated from WorkflowExecutionStarted event, which precedes the firstWorkflowTaskBackoff delay in cron workflows, inflating the reported latency.",
  "proposedFix": "Either subtract firstWorkflowTaskBackoff duration from workflow_endtoend_latency for cron workflows, or introduce new metrics: workflow_scheduletoclose_latency (current behavior), workflow_starttoclose_latency (adjusted), or workflow_cron_execution_latency.",
