  "userImpact": "Users experience inconsistent worker shutdown behavior across SDKs, making it difficult to write portable code and potentially causing activity retry delays and operational confusion.",
  "rootCause": "Different SDKs have evolved different interpretations of graceful shutdown semantics, with TypeScript and others treating grace period as a cancellation delay while Go doesn't wait for activities to complete.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a consistent specification for graceful worker shutdown that all SDKs should follow, clarifying when grace periods apply, when activities are canceled, and ensuring all Core-based SDKs wait for activities to complete.",
  "workaround": "See activity-specific error handling and context cancellation patterns documented in Go SDK; can use custom retry logic to handle worker shutdown scenarios.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "A specification was developed and documented for consistent graceful worker shutdown behavior across SDKs.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "By default all Core based SDKs now will wait for activities to complete before returning from Worker.run.",
