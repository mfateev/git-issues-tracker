  "userImpact": "TypeScript SDK users cannot implement session-based patterns for activity execution affinity and worker-specific concurrency control that Go SDK users have access to.",
  "rootCause": "TypeScript SDK lacks the Sessions API that exists in Go SDK, though worker-specific task queues provide alternative pattern.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement Sessions API in TypeScript SDK with concurrency control similar to Go SDK, or provide clearer documentation on using worker-specific task queue pattern as alternative.",
  "workaround": "Use worker-specific task queues with maxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutions and maxConcurrentActivityTaskExecutions configuration for session-like behavior.",

  "keyQuote": "This appears to have been transferred from the TypeScript SDK issue tracker, but for those wondering, all SDKs support a concept of \"worker-specific task queues\" which basically provides session behavior.",
