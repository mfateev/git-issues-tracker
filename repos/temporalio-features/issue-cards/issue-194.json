  "summary": "SDKs have inconsistent behavior when scheduling timers with duration <= 0. The server rejects duration <= 0, while different SDKs either throw errors, apply minimums, or skip scheduling entirely. The feature request asks for consistent cross-SDK behavior to handle zero-duration timers properly.",
