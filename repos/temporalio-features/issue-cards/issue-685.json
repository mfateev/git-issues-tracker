  "summary": "Feature request to prevent sensitive HTTP headers in HostedMCPTool from being serialized into activity input and visible in Temporal UI and worker logs. Users need a way to omit or lazily resolve these headers to avoid exposing secrets.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot securely use HostedMCPTool with sensitive headers because secrets are exposed in Temporal UI and worker logs despite using payload codecs.",
  "rootCause": "HTTP headers are serialized into activity input/history as part of tool config, making them visible in UI and logs regardless of codec encryption.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a mechanism to omit headers from serialization or lazily resolve them at activity execution time, or allow codec servers to redact specific payload portions before UI display.",
  "workaround": "Use a payload codec server that omits sensitive portions from payloads in its response, preventing them from appearing in the UI.",

  "keyQuote": "the tokens still show up in plain text when someone browses the Temporal UI — which isn't ideal from a security perspective",
