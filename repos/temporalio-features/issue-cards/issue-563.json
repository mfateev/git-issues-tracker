  "userImpact": "Users cannot effectively alert on unexpected workflow failures because metric cardinality issues prevent tagging exception types, forcing workarounds with custom search attributes.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow_failed counter metric lacks exception type tags, making it impossible to distinguish between business-intentional failures and unexpected failures for alerting purposes.",
  "proposedFix": "Add exception type as a tag to the workflow_failed counter metric; alternatively, allow specifying exception severity levels that can be tagged and filtered in metrics.",
  "workaround": "Users currently resort to custom search attributes with upserted business failure values or custom metrics, though not all SDKs support custom metric tags.",
