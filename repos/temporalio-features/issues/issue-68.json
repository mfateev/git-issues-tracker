But I would definitely support altering both the Go and TS samples to make them compatible with each other and use NaCl. How you'll test that is a different story.\r\n\r\nI think the simplest approach for authenticated encryption is just secret box (no need for PKI setup). So https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox in Go and I guess https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js#secret-key-authenticated-encryption-secretbox or https://github.com/tonyg/js-nacl#secret-key-authenticated-encryption-crypto_secretbox or something in JS.","createdAt":"2022-07-13T17:37:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/68#issuecomment-1183500007","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5Gi__R","author":{"login":"lorensr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@robholland agrees on not providing a library, and offered to help with compatibility","createdAt":"2022-07-13T19:08:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/68#issuecomment-1183580113","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5Gl8mf","author":{"login":"robholland"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/pull/171","createdAt":"2022-07-14T11:49:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/68#issuecomment-1184352671","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5Gl9lU","author":{"login":"robholland"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"To get to interop quickly I just adjusted the TS crypto usage rather than porting all of our samples to nacl.","createdAt":"2022-07-14T11:54:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/68#issuecomment-1184356692","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6EysLu","author":{"login":"robholland"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@josh-berry this can actually be closed, the mentioned PR fixed the incompatibility.
