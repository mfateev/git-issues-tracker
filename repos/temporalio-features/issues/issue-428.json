I think this should basically just be a single `GetStatus(waitForStage? = dontWait) -> WorkflowUpdateInfo` call on the update handle. If no stage is provided, this is a non-blocking call, otherwise it waits until that stage is reached (looping if needed when long-poll timeout comes back as empty). The `WorkflowUpdateInfo` should have the current stage it is on and the result if there is any. The `GetResult` call that exists today (when a result is not already obtained from start) should just be a thin wrapper for this that waits for `COMPLETED` and returns the success outcome or throws on failure.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs59eyl-","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We may want to call this \"describe\" instead","createdAt":"2024-05-10T20:21:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/428#issuecomment-2105223550","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-02-29T20:58:16Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":428,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Workflow Update Get-Status (and Wait-For-Stage) Capability","updatedAt":"2024-05-10T20:21:30Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/428"}
