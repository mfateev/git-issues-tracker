Java and Go do though.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [ ] Go - Already done for some fields/errors\n- [ ] Java - Done for all but Nexus handler exception\n- [x] Core - N/A\n- [ ] TypeScript - TODO\n- [ ] Python - TODO\n- [ ] .NET - TODO\n- [ ] Ruby - TODO\n- [ ] PHP - TODO\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-19T12:46:20Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":676,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Append some details to error messages","updatedAt":"2025-09-19T12:46:20Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/676"}
