This should be resolved correctly and the env var removed.\n\nThe problem is described here\n\n> We have a bit of older logic that checks after our tests if any workflows are still running. Repeatedly every 100ms, to a max of 5s, it makes a Go SDK `ListOpenWorkflowExecutions` + `ListClosedWorkflowExecutions` call to see if any of the returned workflows have a status of `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STATUS_RUNNING`. If after 5s there is still one with that status, we fail. We saw sometime approx between Oct 10th and Oct 25th, our assertion here started failing in cloud (and still does). The workflows were completing (in milliseconds) but even after 5s these were returning stale data in cloud saying that status was still running.\n\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/features/pull/579 has updated to use the preferred `ListWorkflow` API, but the problem remains.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-01-17T19:09:23Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":581,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Features Platform] Remove TEMPORAL_FEATURES_DISABLE_WORKFLOW_COMPLETION_CHECK workaround","updatedAt":"2025-01-17T19:09:23Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/581"}
