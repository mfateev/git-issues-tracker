Please describe.\r\n\r\nWorkers are identified by a build ID (a.k.a binary checksum), which is stored on workflow task completions for debugging and resetting purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen a user makes a bad deployment that breaks determinism - e.g. adding an activity - without using workflow versioning, there may be histories generated by both old and new versions of workflow code.\r\nWhen the system reaches this state, versioning APIs may not be used since they will cause further non determinism.\r\nAt this point, users will either terminate, reset, or try to deploy new workflow code that uses start time or other heuristics for switching the old/new logic.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nExpose build ID via WorkflowInfo so that users can switch based on it and unblock both new and old workflows.","closedAt":"2024-01-12T21:21:32Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5vueFf","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I just reopened this, we need it in Java and Go too and to be exposed in lang SDKs on top of Core.","createdAt":"2024-01-02T19:28:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/253#issuecomment-1874452831","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5vy3i7","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Can you clarify whether we should consider this \"unsafe\" information?
