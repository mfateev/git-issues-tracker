Please describe.\n\nThe new worker versioning-3 implementation requires the annotation of workflows so that if they are pinned, it will not try to move them immediately to a new version, waiting for them to finish before garbage-collecting workers. The benefit of that is that short-running workflows, marked as pinned, do not need to get patched.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe goal is to take advantage of code annotations when the language supports them, and the SDK already uses them for other purposes. If that is not the case, a programmatic API should be provided to add this annotation, and it should be invoked during the first workflow task executed by the workflow. \n \n### Additional context\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Make sure we mark old APIs deprecated \n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n- [x] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1832\n- [x] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2458\n- [x] Core - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/889\n- [x] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1659\n- [x] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/793\n- [x] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/437\n- [x] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/237\n- [ ] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/586\n","closedAt":"2025-06-03T16:22:01Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-10-08T18:46:47Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":548,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Workflow annotations for versioning","updatedAt":"2025-06-03T16:22:01Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/548"}
