TBD the exact values, but early thoughts are \"if the task start time is +/- 1 minute from current worker system time when task is started\". For Core SDKs, this needs to be done in lang because it's important to check when the task is actually being worked on and not when it's received from server, and only lang knows that. It's TBD on whether this users need to be able to disable/customize this.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [ ] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1926\n- [ ] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2484\n- [x] Core - N/A (we _think_ Core exposes all the times necessary here, but may need to check)\n- [ ] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1688\n- [ ] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/839\n- [ ] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/459\n- [ ] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/250\n- [ ] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/603\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\n","closedAt":"2025-09-23T20:07:42Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs7GNTWH","author":{"login":"Sushisource"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We're not gonna do this.
