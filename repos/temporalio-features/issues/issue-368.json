Please describe.\r\n\r\nEager Workflow Start (EWS) is a latency optimization that eliminates matching, and a database round trip, for the first task of a workflow. See #242 for details.  EWS in Cloud is currently blocked on the need of an end-to-end test that demonstrates that the first workflow task is eagerly dispatched to a local worker. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe solution should reuse the client connection for starter and worker, and initiate a simple workflow with the eager flag set to true. The first task of this workflow should be immediately returned to the starter, and dispatched to the worker without retries.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2023-11-22T00:40:01Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-11-06T23:59:59Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":368,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add an Eager Workflow Start test for Cloud","updatedAt":"2023-11-22T00:40:01Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/368"}
