We could add some simple code to skip based on the signal. This will be much simpler than any other alternatives that I have seen.\r\nreset with cherry pick some signals but not all. Currently we have the option to preserve all signals after reset point, or none. But it’s a hard decision when we want to preserve some.\r\nReset with some special behavior— just let the workflow knows that current run is in a reset state so that it can adjust the behavior accordingly.\r\nEtc etc\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6Rhtwk","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This may be similar to #1203","createdAt":"2024-10-28T13:04:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/553#issuecomment-2441534500","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6Rkrqw","author":{"login":"longquanzheng"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"> This may be similar to #1203\r\n\r\nYeah that looks very similar: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/1203","createdAt":"2024-10-28T18:21:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/553#issuecomment-2442312368","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-10-25T15:51:56Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":553,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"allow reset API to bring new signals as atomic operation","updatedAt":"2024-10-28T18:21:39Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/553"}
