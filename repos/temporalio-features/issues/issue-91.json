Please describe.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the server can change how it behaves to different SDK versions, e.g. for backwards-compatibility workarounds like https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/1949. This could be useful in the future for filtering out event types or fields that SDKs don't need to be aware of.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nWe decided a feature list was the most maintainable solution (so the server doesn't have to keep track of which versions of which SDK support which feature). If the list gets too long we can start grouping things. I forgot to follow up on this part of the solution in September, so doing it now.\r\n\r\nSDKs should send the `supported-features` header with an initial value of `follows-next-run-id`, since they all support that now.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/1949\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/c2a3a2bdfb6377a633928203ffe577281da216d1/common/headers/headers.go#L37\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/c2a3a2bdfb6377a633928203ffe577281da216d1/common/headers/versionChecker.go#L54\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/c2a3a2bdfb6377a633928203ffe577281da216d1/common/headers/versionChecker.go#L150-L156","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-07-27T02:50:50Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":91,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] SDKs should set `supported-features` header","updatedAt":"2022-07-27T02:50:50Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/91"}
