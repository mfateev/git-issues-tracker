This would guard against if I accidentally make changes to `someFunctionThatIsDeterministic` while some workflows are running.\r\n\r\nI think at the moment the best way to do this is to just pass in these sorts of values as arguments to a workflow, or to use activities, but surely a side effect API would be less friction for these sorts of use cases which ultimately encourages writing safer workflows?","createdAt":"2022-11-18T13:24:44Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/561#issuecomment-2486838883","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6UOiZl","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> say I have a long working workflow that calls `someFunctionThatIsDeterministic`\r\n\r\nSide effects are for non-deterministic actions.

You need to leave the workflow sandbox to execute these anyways, so that friction already exists.
