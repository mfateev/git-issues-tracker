This is already supported in native gRPC libraries like Go/Java, but not most Core SDKs. Today, Core SDKs assume string values as ascii headers and Tonic fails if this is done with a `-bin` header.\n\nWe need to accept bytes as RPC metadata values and need to update code to have Tonic set those as binary headers on the metadata map for `-bin` keys.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [x] Go - N/A\n- [x] Java - N/A\n- [ ] Core - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/991\n- [ ] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1778\n- [ ] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/1063\n- [ ] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/512\n- [ ] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/329\n- [x] PHP - N/A\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A since it leans on Go\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-08-27T20:13:38Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":671,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Ensure gRPC binary metadata keys are supported by clients","updatedAt":"2025-08-27T20:48:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/671"}
