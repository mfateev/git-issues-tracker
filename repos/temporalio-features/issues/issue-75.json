One of the important things we must capture is that some filters can work without \"advanced visibility\" and some can work with. But we don't want some locked down advanced filter builder because many people will prefer strings and you'll end up with some full AST-building DSL if you try to solve too much. I think a TS proposal API would be enough to see what it'd look like for other langs.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am not sure you can make pagination that much easier (no you don't want an iterator, you need full pages so you can know/control calls to the server). Also, there's archived, count, etc. And from what I see, `WorkflowExecutionDescription` can be reused here, so this is kinda combined with #17.","createdAt":"2022-07-19T21:17:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/75#issuecomment-1189559969","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-07-19T19:14:23Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":75,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Friendly version of listWorkflowExecutions","updatedAt":"2024-07-13T01:08:11Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/75"}
