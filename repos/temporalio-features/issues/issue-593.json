Please describe.\n\nOptions to affect the priority of tasks in tasks queues were introduced in https://github.com/temporalio/api/pull/513 (note, that's not a merge to main - we should update this item with the merge to main once it happens). Support setting those options in SDKs.\n\nInitial implementation in Go (also not a merge to main) may be referenced here: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1792\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nSee the Go PR. This is all fairly straightforward pass-through of some new options.\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n- [x] Go - PR: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1792\n- [x] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2399\n- [x] Core - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/871\n- [x] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1620\n- [x] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/760\n- [x] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/403\n- [x] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/210\n- [x] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/559\n- [ ] Temporal CLI - tbd - open if anything needed\n","closedAt":"2025-07-23T15:57:44Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6kB4M9","author":{"login":"Sushisource"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Tests for these need only consist of verifying that priority info is sent to server and is received (ex: You can read it out of workflow info)","createdAt":"2025-03-25T17:03:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/593#issuecomment-2751955773","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-02-03T18:19:08Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":593,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Task Queue Priority Options/Annotations","updatedAt":"2025-07-23T15:57:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/593"}
