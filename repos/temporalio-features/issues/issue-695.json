This should not overly expand cardinality on users with properly operating workers/workflows.\n\nAlso while doing this, please confirm this \"gRPC message too large\" determining condition/code works on cloud as expected instead of just self-hosted/dev-server.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [ ] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2114\n- [ ] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2732\n- [ ] Core - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/1065\n- [x] TypeScript - N/A\n- [x] Python - N/A\n- [x] .NET - N/A\n- [x] Ruby - N/A\n- [x] PHP - N/A\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\n","closedAt":"2025-12-02T22:02:26Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-11-07T13:52:07Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":695,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Set `GrpcMessageTooLarge` as `failure_reason` for workflow task failed metric","updatedAt":"2025-12-02T22:02:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/695"}
