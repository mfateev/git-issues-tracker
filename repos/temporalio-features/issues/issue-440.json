Implementation notes:\r\n\r\n* Need every SDK to utilize as much existing gRPC service mechanism as it can, but leave room for potential high-level wrappers\r\n  * Make new high-level client that only has access to the raw for now, knowing high-level wrappers may come\r\n* Keep high-level cloud client separate from existing high-level client since this is not namespace specific\r\n  * Share the connection/service/gRPC logic but not the high-level client logic\r\n* Make sure things work the same wrt metrics and RPC metadata options and such\r\n* No two SDKs are alike here unfortunately, but they are close enough\r\n\r\nTasks:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Incorporate into https://github.com/temporalio/api and https://github.com/temporalio/api-go\r\n  * Merge approach rejected - https://github.com/temporalio/api/pull/378\r\n  * Doing per-lang submodule, first step is to backport needed things: https://github.com/temporalio/api-cloud/pull/20\r\n* [x] Go SDK - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1459\r\n* [x] Java SDK - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2059\r\n* [x] SDK Core - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/737\r\n* [ ] TypeScript SDK - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1416\r\n* [x] Python SDK - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/522\r\n* [x] .NET SDK - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/244\r\n* [ ] PHP SDK - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/476","closedAt":"2025-10-24T13:17:49Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs7NObjN","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Note, this approach has been deprecated.
