This information is only available in server 1.25.\r\n\r\nWhile the API result has build-ID-specific stats, at this time we want the describe result to only have the stats. Here is the specific implementation expectations modeled off of what is already done in Go:\r\n\r\n* \"describe task queue\" should accept options including whether to report stats and report poller info, both of which should default to false\r\n* This describe call should return a \"task queue description\" that right now only contains a map of \"types\" with the key as an \"task queue type\" enumerate and value of \"task queue type info\". This will contain information for the unversioned task queue only (later we will add build-ID-specific forms).\r\n* \"task queue type\" should be an enumerate with worker, activity, and nexus values\r\n* \"task queue type info\" should contain a collection of \"pollers\" (of type \"task queue poller info\") and \"stats\" (of type \"task queue stats\"). See Go SDK and API for the values of each of those types\r\n\r\n### Per-SDK Tickets\r\n\r\n⚠️ Waiting on per-SDK issues until the solution as described is confirmed acceptable\r\n\r\n- [x] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/1553 (among others)\r\n- [ ] Java - TODO\r\n- [x] Core - N/A\r\n- [ ] TypeScript - TODO\r\n- [ ] Python - TODO\r\n- [ ] .NET - TODO\r\n- [ ] PHP - TODO\r\n- [ ] Temporal CLI - TODO (partially done) \r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6-mdYM","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Note, enhanced is deprecated.","createdAt":"2025-08-18T17:07:39Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/525#issuecomment-3197752844","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-08-15T12:17:08Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":525,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"High-level task queue describe call with default-build-ID stats","updatedAt":"2025-08-18T17:07:39Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/525"}
