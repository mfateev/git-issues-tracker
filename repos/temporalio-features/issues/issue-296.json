Core will send the first activation for this (when replaying) with two jobs: `[StartWorkflow, DoUpdate]`. If the SDK supports lazily registering update handlers (which, hopefully maybe just... don't, is the nice solution), then the SDK must take care to ensure that the workflow function is run at least once first so that the update handler has a chance to be registered. Otherwise, the SDK will erroneously encounter a nondeterminism error, thinking the update should be rejected (because no handler was found) when it was in fact accepted.","createdAt":"2023-10-06T22:07:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/296#issuecomment-1751451576","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-07-05T16:49:13Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":296,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}},{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Workflow Update SDK integration - Public Preview","updatedAt":"2024-10-08T02:51:36Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/296"}
