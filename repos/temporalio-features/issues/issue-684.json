SDKs have contrib/extra libraries for, say, OpenTelemetry or other aspects. These are traditionally implemented via manual implementations of specific abstractions (e.g. interceptors, metrics handlers, etc). Once #652 is present, SDKs should expose these things as plugins even if many of them may be just one aspect (configuring interceptors).\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [ ] Go - TODO\n- [ ] Java - TODO\n- [x] Core - N/A\n- [ ] TypeScript - TODO\n- [ ] Python - TODO\n- [ ] .NET - TODO\n- [ ] Ruby - TODO\n- [ ] PHP - TODO\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-14T18:57:14Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":684,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Provide plugin implementations for contrib/extra integrations","updatedAt":"2025-10-14T18:57:14Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/684"}
