Please describe.**\nWorkers currently only support identity information, which appears in the UI and CLI via temporal describe task queue. There's no way to attach custom metadata to workers (like environment, version, team ownership, etc.) unless using worker deployments or worker versioning. For users not using these features, there's no operational visibility into worker-specific metadata.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdd support for custom metadata on workers that can be set during worker registration and viewed in both the Temporal UI and CLI. Example for Java SDK:\njavaWorkerOptions options = WorkerOptions.newBuilder()\n    .setIdentity(\"worker-1\")\n    .setMetadata(Map.of(\n        \"environment\", \"production\",\n        \"version\", \"1.0.0\",\n        \"team\", \"platform\"\n    ))\n    .build();\nThe metadata should be displayed in the UI and in CLI commands like temporal describe task queue.\nDescribe alternatives you've considered\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-12-22T17:24:50Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":715,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Custom Metadata Support for Workers in Temporal UI and CLI","updatedAt":"2025-12-28T18:34:22Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/715"}
