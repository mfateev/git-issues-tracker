The `temporal_request` metric only track the attempts made by the client, instead of the actual Workflow execution from the worker side. For example, if we there are no workers running, no matter how many time we request StartWorkflowExecution, no Workflow would actually start.\r\n\r\nI'd still recommend folks to upvote this issue if you do need the worker side metric.","createdAt":"2023-10-07T00:50:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/25#issuecomment-1751534390","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5qaDEB","author":{"login":"tsurdilo"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I'm not really sure this should be an sdk metric as execution is created on service side if workers are around or not. \r\nWould add to service metrics https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/main/common/metrics/metric_defs.go#L884-L889 instead","createdAt":"2023-10-30T13:35:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/25#issuecomment-1785213185","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5qaMSg","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Has value in both places.
