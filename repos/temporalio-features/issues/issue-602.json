Please describe.\n\nWhen a user runs `temporal activity pause`, this should work on long-running activities that heartbeat.\nUsers likely won't have predicted in advance that they're going to need to pause the activity, so ideally this would interrupt the activity's execution by default.\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeally a cancel-like exception could be thrown (in languages where that's appropriate)\n* Users should be able to distinguish between this and cancel, as there maybe different actions they want to take when the activity is ending completely vs when it's going to resume later.\n\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n* [ ] PHP https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/588\n* [x] Python https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/812\n* [x] Java https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2465\n* [x] .NET https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/441\n* [x] Go https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1899\n* [ ] TypeScript https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1665\n* [ ] ruby https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/241\n* [x] core https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/895","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6fO8px","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@drewhoskins-temporal - can you confirm whether there is server-side work? `RecordActivityTaskHeartbeatResponse.activity_paused` is present, just need to confirm if we should _always_ interrupt on that or if interrupt is a separate option the pauser sets and therefore there needs to be another field there.","createdAt":"2025-02-20T13:24:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/602#issuecomment-2671495793","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6lKBc2","author":{"login":"drewhoskins-temporal"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"- Always, for now \n- We can add a flag later to turn it off if people ask for it (but they probably won't).\n\nReasoning:\n- It’s important that by default, pause “just works” if people don’t notice the fine print.\n- Users will be able to write a rule like “Pause activities of type T when they fail” so they probably won’t need it.","createdAt":"2025-04-01T23:00:52Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/602#issuecomment-2770868022","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-02-20T00:14:11Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":602,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Heartbeating activities should be interrupted when the activities are paused.","updatedAt":"2025-06-01T06:07:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/602"}
