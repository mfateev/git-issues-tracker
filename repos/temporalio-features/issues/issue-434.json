Please describe.\n\nWhen serializing/deserializing a payload for a workflow or activity users payload codec/converter may want to know details about the payloads context. For example with workflow input/output, the context could include workflow ID. This can be useful if the users want to sign the payload with the workflowID to help protect against replay attacks. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA solution similar to the Java SDK in other languages, see https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/pull/1695. Also, make sure that the async activity client gets this context too. Note, this information needs to be available to converters too e.g. for outbound client calls, so it's not just for codecs.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [ ] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1352\n- [x] Java - Already exists - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/pull/1695\n- [x] Core - N/A\n- [ ] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1661\n- [x] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/796\n- [x] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/438\n- [ ] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/238\n- [ ] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/587\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\n\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6yn2pC","author":{"login":"GSmithApps"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"~~ignore this -- just posting to follow this issue~~","createdAt":"2025-06-23T14:48:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/434#issuecomment-2996791874","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-03-07T22:44:30Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":434,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":6}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Serialization context for codecs and converters","updatedAt":"2025-10-01T14:43:32Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/434"}
