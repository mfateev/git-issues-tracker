Please describe.\r\nWhen performing a batch operation such as a reset or pause, I'd like to be able to query for workflows that are failing and in which their failure fits a certain failure pattern, for example they might have a non-determinism error or have a certain stuck activity.\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is.
