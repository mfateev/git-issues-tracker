Please describe.\r\n\r\nGiven the following sequence:\r\n\r\n- A workflow starts a child workflow (call that one A).\r\n- Child workflow A does CAN (that’s B).\r\n- The parent workflow cancels the child workflow (using the run_id of A, as that's the only one it knows).\r\n\r\nOne would reasonably expect Workflow B to receive the cancellation (same for signals). In fact, this is what indeed happens _after the parent workflow closes_ if child workflow A is started with `PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_REQUEST_CANCEL`.\r\n\r\nYet, it appears that, at least in TS, B is not receiving explicit cancellation requests made by the parent workflow.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nBasically, I believe that server should treat `RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionCommandAttributes` with a `run_id` and `child_workflow_only = true` the same way as `first_execution_run_id` does in client APIs.
