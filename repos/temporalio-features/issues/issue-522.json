It has been decided to:\r\n\r\n* Align `local_activity_` metrics in Core with Go and Java by default\r\n* Have an opt-in option that can be set to revert to today's behavior\r\n* Make sure every Core-based SDK, when they upgrade core next, also expose this option\r\n* Make sure every Core-based SDK, when they released with upgraded core next, have very clear release notes about this metric behavior change\r\n\r\n### Per-SDK Tickets\r\n\r\n- [x] Go - N/A\r\n- [x] Java - N/A\r\n- [ ] Core - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/796\r\n- [ ] TypeScript - After Core\r\n- [ ] Python - After Core\r\n- [ ] .NET - After Core\r\n- [x] PHP - N/A\r\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\r\n","closedAt":"2024-09-16T20:08:09Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-08-14T21:22:10Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":522,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support local_activity_X based metrics in Core-based SDKs","updatedAt":"2024-09-16T20:08:09Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/522"}
