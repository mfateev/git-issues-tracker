Feedback from user:\r\n\r\n> I’m working on setting up encryption, following the [example in the TS sdk](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/encryption/README.md). It feels… like a lot of setup. Am I missing something? Is there nothing more plug-and-play that we can use?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\r\n\r\n> I suppose I would have expected encryption to be something that could be handled by the SDK (perhaps disabled by default), on the client-side. Our workers/clients could provide a key and perhaps an algorithm, and that would be all. A codec server could be deployed on our side, (maybe distributed as a docker image) by Temporal.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5muvb9","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I think there are too many choices in how to do encryption for this to be in SDK.
