This 💥 technically-backwards-incompatible change is to change SDKs to assume if an API key is provided, that TLS is enabled unless explicitly set otherwise. Some SDKs this can be done more easily than others (e.g. Go may need a `TLSDisabled` field).\n\nThis is a backwards incompatible change, but only for self-hosting users with no TLS but still using relatively-recent API key SDK functionality. This is likely rare or doesn't happen at all (though it may in proxy scenarios), but needs to be clearly called out in release notes with explainer on how to re-disable TLS.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [x] Go - TODO\n- [ ] Java - TODO\n- [x] Core - N/A\n- [x] TypeScript - TODO\n- [x] Python - TODO\n- [x] .NET - TODO\n- [x] Ruby - TODO\n- [ ] PHP - TODO\n- [x] Temporal CLI - Done\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-21T20:38:11Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":687,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HOORAY","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Assume TLS enabled if API key provided in SDKs","updatedAt":"2025-12-09T18:06:02Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/687"}
