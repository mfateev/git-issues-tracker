Please describe.\r\n\r\nThe start delay functionality we recently added is only available when starting workflows from a client.\r\nFor feature parity, we should expose this option for child workflows as well.\r\n\r\nThe use case here is to prevent from having to put a long timer (months) at the top of a workflow and force maintaining history compatibility for as long as that workflow lives. This can be done today by starting the workflow from an activity but that loses the parent-child relationship and traceability in the UI.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nExpose start delay in child workflow options.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nFirst we'll need to add support in the API and server and then expose in all of the SDKs.\r\n\r\n### Per-SDK Tickets\r\n\r\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Go - \r\n- [ ] Java - \r\n- [ ] Core - \r\n- [ ] TypeScript - \r\n- [ ] Python - \r\n- [ ] .NET - \r\n- [ ] PHP - \r\n- [ ] Temporal CLI - \r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs7YobHw","author":{"login":"ieure-cio"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Hi @lina-temporal, any chance of an update on this?
