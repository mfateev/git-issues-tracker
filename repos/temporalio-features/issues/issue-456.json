This should be a common design applied to all SDKs. What should be made available (all subject to discussion):\n\n* Current activity slots in use\n* Current workflow slots in use (debatable since this comes and goes so quick)\n* Current workflow cache size (in SDKs that aren't using global caches)\n* Current status per worker type - e.g. \"polling\", \"full\", or \"failure backoff\"\n  * Make sure failure backoff includes the error\n  * Consider way to notify user programmatically upon status change\n* Server reachable (i.e. that client doesn't have any server errors)\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [ ] Go - TODO\n- [ ] Java - TODO\n- [ ] Core - TODO\n- [ ] TypeScript - TODO\n- [ ] Python - TODO\n- [ ] .NET - TODO\n- [ ] Ruby - TODO\n- [ ] PHP - TODO\n- [ ] Temporal CLI - TODO\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs7P4OBB","author":{"login":"dannymcerlean1"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"+1.
