Please describe.\r\n\r\nInstead of just rethrowing gRPC errors, most (all?) SDKs wrap them. This is especially true for not-found.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nMaybe use `WorkflowNotFound` and `ActivityNotFound` that wrap the gRPC versions? But what about the newer namespace not found that can be thrown instead of workflow not found but both have the not found code? Maybe it should just be `NotFound`? And if so, what does that really add over the raw gRPC errors?\r\n\r\nNeeds discussion.\r\n","closedAt":"2023-10-13T22:18:52Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5EMBem","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We should make this an sdk-features issue to make sure it's done properly in all of our SDKs","createdAt":"2022-06-01T18:02:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/59#issuecomment-1144002470","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5pCZlM","author":{"login":"josh-berry"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"The current error-handling regime seems like it's been pretty reasonable, and this would be a breaking change, no?
