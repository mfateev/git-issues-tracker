This could be exposed as a payload visitor or as a more specific decode-history method. That decision is up to the architect that accepts this issue.\n\nToday if a user is in Go, they can use to visit payloads and decrypt them: https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/api/proxy#VisitPayloads. This is present/exposed in no other SDK I am aware of.
