Please describe.\n\nWe use the SSO with Microsoft Entra ID in our organization now. We're giving access to more and more users and it is becoming a nightmare to manage their permissions to namespaces.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe already have groups set up in Entra and would like to leverage them in Temporal as well. So instead of giving permissions to specific users, I would like to give permissions to groups and manage those groups in Entra.","closedAt":"2025-07-11T19:50:31Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs62mne4","author":{"login":"echean"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"SCIM with Entra can solve the user/group management.
