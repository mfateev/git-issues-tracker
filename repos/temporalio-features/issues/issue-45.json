Don't have an eager `healthCheck` and `getSystemInfo` calls in the constructor. \r\n2. `getSystemCapabilities` call should be performed on the first client call in a lazy manner.\r\n3. `healthCheck` endpoint should be exposed on the Client that will allow users to perform a health check for the corresponded gRPC service. It will also allow to initialize a connection in an explicit eager manner and perform initialization activities (system capabilities negotiation right now).\r\n4. There may be a `.connect()` or `.dial` call that establishes the connection and fetches system capabilities and which will allow to provide the same functionality/guarantees as an eager client provides.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/828\r\n- [x] https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/793\r\n- [x] https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/312\r\n- [x] https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/224\r\n- [x] https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/92","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5HxzG7","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@cretz did you expose healthcheck in Go?","createdAt":"2022-08-03T17:04:14Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/45#issuecomment-1204236731","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5Hx58o","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@bergundy - Yes, in the linked Go PR from the description. `Client.CheckHealth()`.
