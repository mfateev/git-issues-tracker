Please describe.\r\n\r\nToday Go (and probably Java) will fatal error the worker if server returns `InvalidArgument` or `NamespaceNotFound`. These were originally assumed to be unrecoverable errors but we are now understanding at least `InvalidArgument` is recoverable (server sends `InvalidArgument` if the gRPC deadline is too close to now).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nEvery SDK should react the same to seeing a worker error. They should probably mimic core in that they retry for so long, even fatal ones, before actually being fatal.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-01-25T21:09:23Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":218,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] SDKs should not fatal the worker on any error without a retry period","updatedAt":"2024-07-13T01:07:12Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/218"}
