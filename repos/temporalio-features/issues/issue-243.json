Please describe.\r\n\r\nWhen a workflow is started by a schedule some extra information is written to search attributes\r\n\r\n* The TemporalScheduledStartTime [Search Attribute](https://docs.temporal.io/visibility#search-attribute)Link preview icon is added to the Workflow Execution. The value is the Action's timestamp.\r\n* The TemporalScheduledById Search Attribute is added to the Workflow Execution. The value is the Schedule Id.\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way to access this info is through search attributes, this is difficult for users to discover and work with in some SDKs\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nA separate API to return this information if the workflow was started by a schedule.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n(https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTDTU3J4T/p1678200766095479)\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6J9P1_","author":{"login":"dreamworld"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I also run into this problem, one possible way is to use the deprecated `GetInfo` api\r\n```go\r\nvar startTime time.Time\r\np := workflow.GetInfo(ctx).SearchAttributes.GetIndexedFields()[\"TemporalScheduledStartTime\"]\r\nerr := converter.GetDefaultDataConverter().FromPayload(p, &startTime)\r\n```\r\n[ref](https://community.temporal.io/t/passing-workflow-start-time-via-schedule/7861/4)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new typed api `workflow.GetTypedSearchAttributes(ctx).GetTime()` requires `internal.SearchAttributeKeyTime`, which cannot be referenced inside workflow","createdAt":"2024-08-28T07:28:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/243#issuecomment-2314534271","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6J_8Ur","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> requires internal.SearchAttributeKeyTime, which cannot be referenced inside workflow\r\n\r\nThis is available on the `temporal` package: https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk/temporal#SearchAttributeKeyTime","createdAt":"2024-08-28T12:53:45Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/243#issuecomment-2315240747","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6Wcn_C","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Note here, we may use something besides search attributes in the future: https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6364.
