Users want to access the actual class instance of a workflow from, say, an interceptor. This needs to be made available from the workflow context as the \"instance\". Note this is not applicable to Go and TypeScript. And for Java, PHP, Ruby, and .NET (DI only), the activity instance should be made available from the activity context (since they create the instance and control its lifetime).\r\n\r\n- [x] Go - N/A\r\n- [ ] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2361\r\n- [x] Core - N/A\r\n- [x] TypeScript - N/A: Workflows and Activities are simple functions, not classes\r\n- [ ] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/720\r\n- [ ] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/388\r\n- [ ] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/180\r\n- [ ] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/546\r\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6aa01P","author":{"login":"josh-berry"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Also need to do this for Nexus as well (for Java, and for other langs once ready).","createdAt":"2025-01-14T17:55:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/572#issuecomment-2590723407","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-01-07T13:33:37Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":572,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"Access to workflow/activity instance created by Temporal from workflow/activity context where applicable","updatedAt":"2025-01-14T17:55:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/572"}
