Please describe.\r\n\r\nToday the JSON output from UI and `tctl` isn't in proto JSON format for enums so we have to change it in each SDK so we can load into history object via proto JSON tools.\r\n\r\nSome (all?) history JSON converters will perform this enum conversion (prefixing, snake-casing, and uppercasing) even if it has already been done. This prevents us from potentially changing the output of UI/`tctl` to use proper proto JSON with this conversion already done.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nMake sure all SDKs only perform the enum conversion if not already done. Meaning they should ignore conversion if already done by the incoming JSON. Specifically tests should confirm that unconverted _and_ converted JSON _both_ work when provided to the replay API.\r\n\r\n### Specific issues\r\n\r\n* [ ] Go (this one is interesting because the converted form is native, so we need to just confirm unconverted works)\r\n* [ ] Java\r\n* [ ] TypeScript\r\n* [ ] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/118\r\n* [ ] PHP","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-08-30T14:41:52Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":121,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] No history JSON conversion if already done","updatedAt":"2024-07-13T01:07:55Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/121"}
