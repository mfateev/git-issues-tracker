Please describe.\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\n\nWe have some Workflows which are triggered manually from the Temporal UI. For auditing purposes, we want to record who initiated the workflow along with our change events. This information is available in the `WorkflowExecutionStarted` event, but the Workflow does not have access to that (without building an Activity which calls the Temporal API to retrieve it).\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\nAdd the `identity` field of the `WorkflowExecutionStarted` event somewhere in the Workflow info.\n\nIt would also be nice to be able to get something similar for Signals and Updates, but for our use case those aren't triggered manually so currently we pass that info in as an input.\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\nhttps://temporalio.slack.com/archives/C01DKSMU94L/p1759393994977249\n","closedAt":"2025-10-24T15:54:18Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs7Jo16j","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"> Add the `identity` field of the `WorkflowExecutionStarted` event somewhere in the Workflow info.\n\nThis doesn't require any API updates in this repo, can be done just SDK side. But it should be known that client `identity` is not the same as \"user\". By default in SDKs it's process ID + hostname (and sometimes system username if sent from CLI), but it can be overridden. There are discussions underway about providing user identifying information in these events.\n\nIs exposing `identity` enough, or should this be for a general concept of user identity (which may not be the same as client identity)?","createdAt":"2025-10-08T15:28:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/681#issuecomment-3382927011","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs7Jo16u","author":{"login":"tsurdilo"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"imho client identity thats available in WorkflowExecutionStarted event is good","createdAt":"2025-10-08T16:50:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/681#issuecomment-3382927022","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs7Jo2yB","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Ok, I have transferred this issue from API to the `features` repository and altered the title.
