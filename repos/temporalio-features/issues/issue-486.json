Specifically from a user POV we will start out with:\n\n* Fixed \"static summary\" and \"static details\" on workflow start (includes signal with start and child workflow and scheduled workflows)\n  * EDIT: Late requirement - make sure these two items are available when describing a workflow and when describing a schedule of a workflow (will open issues for languages that don't have it)\n* Updateable-within-workflow \"current details\" string\n* Workflow metadata query that includes \"current details\" above and, if available, information about registered signals/queries/updates\n* \"summary\" on timer start (can serve as \"timer ID\")\n* \"summary\" on activity\n\nThe text format of summary/description is TBD (probably some form of mini markdown). More metadata may be added in the future.\n\n### Per-Project Tickets\n* [x] API - https://github.com/temporalio/api/pull/371\n* [x] Server - https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/pull/5857 and https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6412 and https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/issues/6413\n* [x] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1565 and https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1673\n* [x] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2216 and https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/335 and https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2268\n* [x] Core - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/830\n* [x] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1544 (after Core)\n* [x] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/670 (after Core)\n* [x] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/359 (after Core)\n* [x] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/217\n* [x] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/517 (after Go)\n* [ ] Temporal CLI - https://github.com/temporalio/cli/issues/690 (after Go)\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6MpOQ1","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@cretz Is this issue a duplicate of https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/51?","createdAt":"2024-09-18T23:22:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/486#issuecomment-2359616565","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6NJ_jT","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Yes, I think it basically is (or rather this includes that).","createdAt":"2024-09-23T13:15:00Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/486#issuecomment-2368207059","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-05-22T15:40:19Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":486,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"User metadata and workflow metadata query","updatedAt":"2025-08-11T23:50:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/486"}
