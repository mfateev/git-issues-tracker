Please describe.\r\n\r\nIf the SDK encounters an unknown SDK flag on replay, often due to downgrading an SDK, SDKs should behave consistently. Currently the SDKs behave differently:\r\n\r\n* Fail the workflow task (Go and Java)\r\n* Ignore the unknown flag (Core)\r\n\r\nOriginally when we added SDK flags we said the SDK should fail on an unknown flag. Ignoring the unknown flag makes it easier to roll back an SDK, but also puts the workflow into an inconsistent state.\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-02-27T16:31:23Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":427,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Unknown SDK flag should behave consistently across SDK","updatedAt":"2024-02-27T16:31:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/427"}
