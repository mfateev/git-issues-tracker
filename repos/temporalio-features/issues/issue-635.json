Newer SDKs should too.\n\nEven though this is immutable data and was put on TypeScript as info, Go and Java have this directly on the workflow context and it'll make sense for newer SDKs to do the same. Also make sure there is an obvious way to differentiate the absence of a \"last result\" and a null one.\n\nAlso, although it's technically an array in history/Core, langs should treat this as a single value.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [x] Go - Done\n- [x] Java - Done \n- [x] Core - Done\n- [x] TypeScript - Done\n- [x] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/383\n- [x] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/489\n- [ ] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/281\n- [x] PHP - Done (maybe missing last error?)\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-06-09T14:14:34Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":635,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Provide last result and last failure to workflows","updatedAt":"2025-10-14T20:19:14Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/635"}
