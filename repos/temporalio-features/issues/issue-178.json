Please describe.\r\n\r\nSome information about signals is not available within a signal handler. Example of this information is a time the signal was received by a workflow and signal eventId.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nAdd GetSignalInfo call that can be called only from a signal handler and returns this information.\r\n\r\nAn option for Go would be adding GetSignalWithInfoChannel, which returns a Channel with Signal structures that include info + Value. This can be extended to return a single channel for all (or subset) of signals as this would allow guarantee in-order processing. Then the signal name would be a part of Signal structure.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5PtaSW","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We also don't provide this information for timer completion, activity completion, query, etc. If we need event time and event ID, we should provide a general \"get event info\".","createdAt":"2022-12-05T13:04:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/178#issuecomment-1337304214","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-12-04T17:28:45Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":178,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Add GetSignalInfo","updatedAt":"2024-07-13T01:07:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/178"}
