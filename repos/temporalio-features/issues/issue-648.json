Please describe.\n\nOnce the worker shutdown features spec is updated #261, we should write tests in each language\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\nThis is a blurb from `features/activity/shutdown/README.md`, if test ends up being written differently, the README should be updated as well\n\n```\nThe feature workflow should start a few activities and wait for their completion. Then the driver should\nstart worker shutdown. The activities should varyingly accept the cancel, complete successfully,\ncomplete with failure, and ignore the cancel. The one which ignores the cancel should eventually\nencounter a hard timeout.\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n- [ ] Go - \n- [ ] Java - \n- [ ] Core - \n- [ ] TypeScript - \n- [ ] Python - \n- [ ] .NET - \n- [ ] Ruby - \n- [ ] PHP - \n- [ ] Temporal CLI - \n","closedAt":"2025-08-21T20:48:00Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-08T21:57:07Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":648,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Write tests for worker shutdown","updatedAt":"2025-08-21T20:48:00Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/648"}
