In particular, if the workflow ID conflict policy is `UseExisting`, the `StartWorkflowExecutionResponse` contains the boolean `Started` which indicates if the call actually started a new workflow or not. It might also contain a link that can also be useful.\n\nFor Nexus `WorkflowRunOperation`, it would need the link that being added in https://github.com/temporalio/api/pull/563.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\nWe want to provide some of the information in `StartWorkflowExecutionResponse`. This can achieved if we add a optional object pointer in `StartWorkflowOptions` that can be populated by the SDK internals. Example solution:\n\n```go\ntype StartWorkflowResultInfo struct {\n\tLink *commonpb.Link\n}\n\ntype StartWorkflowOptions struct {\n\t...\n\tResultInfo *StartWorkflowResultInfo\n}\n\nfunc ExecuteWorkflow(...) (...) {\n\t...\n\n\tif options.ResultInfo != nil {\n\t\toptions.ResultInfo.Link = resp.Link\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n- [ ] Go - \n- [ ] Java - \n- [ ] Core - \n- [ ] TypeScript - \n- [ ] Python - \n- [ ] .NET - \n- [ ] Ruby - \n- [ ] PHP - \n- [ ] Temporal CLI - \n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6oWOr3","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"For links, we need to first wait on https://github.com/temporalio/api/pull/563 to be merged and released and available in a server so we can test it even works. We may also need to decide whether we are going to expose the raw proto link or going to make a high level form. We should also update the `Started` boolean, may change the name from \"result info\" (too confusing with actual workflow result IMO), and this may look different in different SDKs of course.","createdAt":"2025-04-23T13:56:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/619#issuecomment-2824399607","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-04-22T22:56:54Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":619,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Expose `StartWorkflowExecutionResponse` fields to `ExecuteWorkflow` API","updatedAt":"2025-04-23T16:25:46Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/619"}
