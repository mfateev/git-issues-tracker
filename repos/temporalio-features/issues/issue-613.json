Investigate (and implement) an approach to testing the pre-patched code. There are struggles with this such as the fact that some people patch with the expectation all pre-patched workflow runs are past a certain point. But it may be doable to assume a certain amount of commands/events are replaying thereby causing patch not to apply.\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [ ] Go - \n- [ ] Java - \n- [ ] Core - \n- [ ] TypeScript - \n- [ ] Python - \n- [ ] .NET - \n- [ ] Ruby - \n- [ ] PHP - \n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-03-31T12:23:00Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":613,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Explore ways of testing pre-patched code in SDKs","updatedAt":"2025-03-31T12:23:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/613"}
