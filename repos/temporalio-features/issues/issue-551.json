During this window, we'd still be time-skipping over potentially arbitrary other events in the workflow (until the \"stop time skipping\" message arrives). There is also the problem that Updates run concurrently with other things in the same workflow, and it may not be appropriate to skip time for those other things.\r\n\r\nA couple approaches here:\r\n1. Make the server handle starting/stopping time-skipping.\r\n2. Do nothing and document that users need to manually control when to skip and when not to skip. Then users can make more informed decisions that are specific to their particular scenario.","createdAt":"2024-12-03T18:25:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/551#issuecomment-2515290517","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-10-21T16:27:30Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":551,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Waiting on update result should auto-skip time in time-skipping environments","updatedAt":"2024-12-03T18:25:02Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/551"}
