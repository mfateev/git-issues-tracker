Can we make an issue to have the sdk-features tool also work on commit hashes the way it does with versions/paths today? I know exactly how I'd support commit hashes in all 4 of our SDK languages in this repo.\r\n\r\nThen you have just one container for \"sdk features\" (updated as the features and harness are) and it's able to be run for any SDK lang and version or commit hash.\r\n\r\nThat is way better than making a container for every push to every SDK and every push to this repo. It's silly to create a hundreds of containers instead of just maintaining one sdk-features container that is capable of loading what is wanted. It is also a powerful abstraction to have one, up-to-date sdk-features container anyone can use to test any server with any SDK lang and version/commit.","createdAt":"2022-07-19T10:43:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/71#issuecomment-1188897558","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5G6uMz","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"As discussed during planning today, we'll build a separate container per SDK version but make sure to use the runner for downloading the SDK and building the docker image.","createdAt":"2022-07-20T03:59:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/71#issuecomment-1189798707","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-07-19T00:55:23Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":71,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Create test containers from sdk-features for each SDK","updatedAt":"2023-08-25T14:32:46Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/71"}
