This means that calls of the pattern insert/update thing then list that thing may not return results reflecting the change that was just made. Our specs should document this, and our tests should deal with it by retrying the list calls until they match what is expected.\r\n\r\nOriginal issue below \r\n----\r\n\r\nIn `schedule/basic/feature.go` the call to list schedules often fails against Cloud due to not finding the just-created schedule when calling list schedules.\r\n\r\nThis is temporarily being worked around with a retry loop which should not be necessary.\r\n\r\nThis could very well be a cloud issue, but this issue serves to track the removal of the retry loop.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-12-06T19:05:12Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc0","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":182,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Document that list workflow/schedule calls are eventually consistent in specs","updatedAt":"2024-07-13T01:07:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/182"}
