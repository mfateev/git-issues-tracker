Currently its registered w/worker factory but the worker services multiple workflows so need option to apply interceptor to a workflow or subset of workflows.\n\n### Additional context\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n* [ ] Go - \n* [ X ] Java - \n* [ ] Core - \n* [ ] TypeScript - \n* [ ] Python - \n* [ ] .NET - \n* [ ] PHP - \n* [ ] Temporal CLI -\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6AMLOR","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The interceptor is meant to be an advanced flexible thing. If you want logic that only applies to certain namespaces, or certain task queues, or certain workflow types, or certain prefixed workflow IDs, or if only a certain header is present, or whatever, then you can add that condition in your interceptor.
