The display name shown in the Temporal UI remains static, making it difficult to identify specific executions.\r\n\r\n**Requested Feature:**\r\n\r\nEnable dynamic setting of the display name for activities to improve visibility and distinguish between multiple invocations of the same activity method.\r\n\r\n**Use Case:**\r\n\r\nIn workflows, a single activity method is invoked more than 10 times, each time with a different purpose passed as parameters. The current static display name does not reflect the specific purpose of each invocation, making it difficult to identify and manage these activities in the Temporal UI.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nAllow developers to dynamically set the display name for activities during runtime, possibly by introducing a new option or method within the `RegisterActivityWithOptions` function.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs5tw8_C","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This request is a reasonable one, but should be more generic given this is a generic repo for features across SDKs and the value can be applied generically.\r\n\r\nSo, I think there may be value in a \"Ability to set UI-visible metadata on items\". This may just end up being a predefined header name that is exposed in each SDK differently.
