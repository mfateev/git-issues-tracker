We offer users the ability to do describe and history fetch, we don't need to combine the calls for them. If it's too hard to call history and extract the input, we can maybe make that easier. But I don't think we should fetch history during the very simple describe call.\r\n\r\nAnd I consider input as part of history, server should not change/hack just for someone not willing to make the proper history to get history input. This is not just workflow input, it's workflow result, signal input, etc. These are history.\r\n\r\n> Hard to look up input based on WID\r\n\r\nCan you provide proposals to make this easier SDK side without infecting the simple concept of \"describe\" and without unnecessary server alterations? We have the ability to get result, do you need a separate \"get input\"? Or do you need some helpers/shortcuts when getting history?","createdAt":"2023-04-10T13:05:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/256#issuecomment-1501792729","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-04-07T05:47:08Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":256,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Return input when describing WE","updatedAt":"2024-07-13T01:07:03Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/256"}
