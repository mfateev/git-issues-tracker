That the general marker command/event accepts headers doesn't necessarily mean that the local activity form of markers should populate them. The purpose of headers is to propagate information to the next item, not to be visible in history/UI, and headers for local activities do serve this purpose. To start adding everyone's local activity headers to history now is 1) a behavior change that some users may not want, and 2) not necessary for the primary purpose of headers (to propagate information).\n\nCan you give information on why users need local activity headers to be visible in history? Many users may similarly want parameters to be in history too but we want history to only be what is needed to operate. We do offer \"summary\" for local activities and we may be able to offer other metadata mechanisms to see things in history without using the propagation-mechanism of headers as a history store.","createdAt":"2025-08-13T15:38:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/663#issuecomment-3184434122","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-08-13T07:12:04Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":663,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Setting headers on LocalActivities not recorded on EventHistory","updatedAt":"2025-08-13T15:38:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/663"}
