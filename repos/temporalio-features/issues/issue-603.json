Specifically, SDKs need to:\n\n* Have a `RawValue` class/wrapper/whatever that only has a single payload in it and nothing else\n* Ignore traditional payload conversion in either direction if this type is in use (needs to be in composite payload converter to ignore so it works even for customized forms, TBD in Go/Java whether codec wrappers need to skip payload converter)\n* If possible (so not Go/Java), expose payload converter _without codec_ to activity context and workflow context so it can be used on these raw values as the activity/workflow author see fit\n\nThis is useful for a couple of use cases:\n\n* Dynamic things (#201) since the activity/workflow author may not know what type they want to deserialize until runtime\n* Built-in queries (#604) like `__temporal_workflow_metadata` where we still want the response subject to codecs but not to conversion\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n- [x] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1231\n- [x] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2425\n- [x] Core - N/A\n- [ ] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1629\n- [x] Python - Already supported\n- [x] .NET - Already supported\n- [x] Ruby - Already supported\n- [ ] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/574\n- [x] Temporal CLI - N/A\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-02-21T19:26:48Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":603,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"\"RawValue\" support for non-converted payloads","updatedAt":"2025-07-22T13:56:17Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/603"}
