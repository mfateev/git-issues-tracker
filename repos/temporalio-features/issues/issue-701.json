Please describe.\n\nCurrently Temporal has limits on the max payload size that can be used for operations like starting a workflow or signalling a workflow. If a user hits this limit the request will fail. Currently the Temporal server warns when it detects a payload, but this log is emitted on the server so isn't visible to users who are not hosting Temporal.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWarn if the SDK detects a payload above a certain size (default 512 KB) like the Temporal server does today. This should be applied last after any codec. users should have a clear way to change the threshold for the warning and turn if off.\n\n### Additional context\n\nhttps://docs.temporal.io/cloud/limits#transaction-payload-size-limit\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n- [ ] Go - \n- [ ] Java - \n- [ ] Core - \n- [ ] TypeScript - \n- [ ] .NET - \n- [ ] Ruby - \n- [ ] PHP - \n- [ ] Temporal CLI - \n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-11-18T21:30:35Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":701,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Warn if the SDK tried to send a payload above a specific size","updatedAt":"2026-01-20T20:03:45Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/701"}
