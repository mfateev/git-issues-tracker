Please describe.\n\nLarge workflow history's create several problems in Temporal. They can cause slow replay and add extra load to the server when replaying. After a certain size the server will terminate workflows for being too large. Currently users not hosting there own Temporal server receive no notification that there history size is a problem\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd a warning on the SDK when the SDK detects a large history. This warning should only be emitted once per workflow and not emitted on replay. Users should be able to adjust the warning limit as a worker option.\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n- [ ] Go - \n- [ ] Java - \n- [ ] Core - \n- [ ] TypeScript - \n- [ ] Python - \n- [ ] .NET - \n- [ ] Ruby - \n- [ ] PHP - \n- [ ] Temporal CLI - \n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-12-01T18:53:23Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":705,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Warn if SDK detects a workflow history over a certain size","updatedAt":"2025-12-01T18:53:23Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/705"}
