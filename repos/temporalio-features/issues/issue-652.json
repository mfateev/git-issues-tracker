Please describe.\n\nUsers often need to configure a number of things in order to support certain systems. For instance, all workflows at Company X might need to register a dataconverter, customize the sandbox, register a set of activities, etc. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nA plugin model to allow configuring all these points at once.\n```python\n# In client (would rather have this on client.Interceptor, but people\n# are concerned with the name \"interceptor\" though I prefer it)\nclass Plugin:\n  # NOTE: ClientConnectConfig could help at https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/895\n  async def connect_client(self, config: ClientConnectConfig, next: Plugin) -> Client:\n    # Default impl calls next\n\t  \n  def create_client(self, config: ClientConfig, next: Plugin) -> Client:\n    # Default impl calls next\n    \n# In worker (would rather have this on worker.Interceptor, but people\n# are concerned with the name \"interceptor\" though I prefer it)\nclass Plugin:\n  def create_worker(self, config: WorkerConfig, next: Plugin) -> Worker:\n    # Default impl calls next\n    \n  async def run_worker(self, worker: Worker, next: Plugin) -> None:\n\t  # Default impl calls next\n```\n\nFor example:\n```python\nclass MyPlugin(client.Plugin, worker.Plugin, client.Interceptor, worker.Interceptor):\n  def create_client(self, config: ClientCreateConfig, next: Plugin) -> Client:\n    # Say you want to set data converter and interceptor\n    config[\"data_converter\"] = MyDataConverter()\n    config[\"interceptors\"].append(self)\n    return super().create_client(config, next)\n    \n  def create_worker(self, config: WorkerCreateConfig, next: Plugin) -> Worker:\n    # Say you want an activity\n    config[\"activities\"].append(MyActivity())\n    return super().create_worker(config, next)\n    \n  async def run_worker(self, worker: Worker, next: Plugin) -> None:\n    try:\n      await super().run_worker(worker, next)\n    finally:\n      # Say you want to do something on worker shutdown\n      do_some_cleanup()\n      \n  def intercept_activity(self, next: ActivityInboundInterceptor) -> ActivityInboundInterceptor:\n    # Say you want to intercept activities\n    return MyActivityInterceptor(next)\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n\n### Per-SDK Tickets\n\n<!-- Add links here once the tickets are created (no need to create them immediately). -->\n\n- [ ] Go - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/2020\n- [ ] Java - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2626\n- [ ] Core - N/A\n- [x] TypeScript - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1764\n- [x] Python - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/950 and https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/1011\n- [x] .NET - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/507\n- [x] Ruby - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-ruby/issues/318\n- [ ] PHP - https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/644\n- [ ] Temporal CLI - N/A\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6-PJiI","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Note to implementers - there are also replayer behaviors that have to be accounted for in the worker plugin. The client options should accept client plugins (that also become worker plugins if they implement that interface too), and the worker options should accept worker plugins. Each language may have its challenges here, but the idea is to basically follow the interceptor model.","createdAt":"2025-08-15T14:30:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/652#issuecomment-3191642248","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-07-09T15:43:37Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":652,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Plugins to support controlling multiple configuration points at once","updatedAt":"2026-01-06T16:26:34Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/652"}
