This would accept the same input as the workflow, but can only error not return a value. Right now, especially in our languages that let you predefine handlers, it is tough to have an update/signal handler rely on workflow input.\n\n* [x] php https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-php/issues/480\n* [x] typescript https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1483\n  * Completely unsure how to do this, maybe not worth it. But maybe we can encourage people to do file-level code.\n \n* [x] java https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/865\n  * Implementation class would have a `@WorkflowInitMethod` or `@WorkflowConstructor` or something on the constructor\n\n* [x] python https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/issues/600\n  * `@workflow.init` can be put on `__init__` of the workflow class\n\n* [x] go https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/1576\n  * Not _needed_ in Go but people may like it. Can either be a register option, or maybe we can start accepting structs as workflows that must have a `Run()` call, but if they also have an `Init()` call we invoke that. Unsure, may not even be wanted\n\n* [x] .NET - Done\n  * `[WorkflowInit]` already supported in this manner on .NET workflow class constructors\n\nNOTE: This is still conceptual and subject to architectural and value discussions on whether we even want to do this much less how.","closedAt":"2026-01-02T18:51:07Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6G_pqK","author":{"login":"roxblnfk"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Is it implied that tasks can be run in the init method?","createdAt":"2024-08-02T08:17:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/400#issuecomment-2264832650","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGflYbs6HQCx0","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"While it technically would work, it is discouraged.
