I suspect the samples are more education than code/difficulty. I would support that education part being in docs instead of README of sample if/when we can.\r\n\r\nSo this task is more about Temporal confirming behavior and how it looks and the steps and such.","createdAt":"2023-11-29T21:17:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/380#issuecomment-1832713240","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-11-29T20:51:03Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGflYbs7XtLc6","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":380,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Every SDK needs a DataDog sample for sending metrics and traces to DataDog agent","updatedAt":"2023-11-29T21:17:35Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/380"}
