Please describe.**\r\nEach SDK has a little different implementation of gRPC retry/deadline logic and parameters and default values for them.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should write a unified specification including default parameter values and normalize the retrying behavior across SDKs.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nEach SDK went its own way while looking around. And it has to change. There are too many moving parts - deadline_exceeded, timeout of single calls, total default timeouts for different kinds of calls, jitter in retries, etc.","closedAt":"2023-05-23T17:02:07Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5c-SOD","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing in favor of https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/27 since this is a cross SDK issue","createdAt":"2023-05-23T17:02:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/850#issuecomment-1559831427","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-10-28T23:18:06Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":850,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Document gRPC retrying logic and parameters across SDKs and normalize the approach","updatedAt":"2023-05-23T17:02:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/850"}
