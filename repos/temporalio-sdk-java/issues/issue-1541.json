Please describe.**\r\nBefore I connect to my Temporal cluster, I need to connect to the TLS server to get certificate then I could connect to the Temporal cluster. In go language, I could do like below:\r\n```\r\nvar connOptions client.ConnectionOptions\r\n\tif cfg.Temporal.TLSServer != \"\" {\r\n\t\tconnOptions = client.ConnectionOptions{\r\n\t\t\tTLS: &tls.Config{\r\n\t\t\t\tServerName: cfg.Temporal.TLSServer,\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nc, err := client.NewClient(client.Options{\r\n\tHostPort:          cfg.Temporal.HostPort,\r\n\tNamespace:         cfg.Temporal.Namespace,\r\n\tConnectionOptions: connOptions,\r\n})\r\n```\r\nBut in java, i did not find way to do this.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nGot a way to set TLS server in java.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI did not find alternatives ...\r\n","closedAt":"2022-11-27T17:13:19Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5PLDY3","author":{"login":"Spikhalskiy"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Use `ServiceStubsOptions#setChannelInitializer` to intercept the creation of gRPC's `ManagedChannelBuilder`.
