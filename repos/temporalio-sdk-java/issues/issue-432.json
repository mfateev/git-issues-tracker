Datadog's native naming convention is \"dot-separated\". After we've plugged Temporal client into the application's `MeterRegistry` we've noticed that all application metric names got renamed into snake case convention. Ideally, Temporal's SDK metrics should follow the convention of the host application.","closedAt":"2021-04-10T20:01:49Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-04-08T23:34:04Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":432,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"MicrometerClientStatsReporter overrides registry's naming convention","updatedAt":"2021-04-10T20:01:49Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/432"}
