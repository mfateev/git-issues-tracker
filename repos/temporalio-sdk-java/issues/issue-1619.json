Please describe.**\r\n\r\nTemporal Spring Boot Integration is not compatible with Spring Boot 3.0. One specific issue is that `spring.factories` is no longer supported for enabling autoconfiguration, it was deprecated in 2.7 and removed in 3.0 - see https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide#auto-configuration-files. However there may be other issues.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdding support, making changes where necessary (backwards compatibility may be possible).\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2023-01-26T18:52:27Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-01-25T20:32:54Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1619,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support for Spring Boot 3.0 in integration","updatedAt":"2023-01-26T18:52:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1619"}
