Application developers should not assume that signals will be processed only after an initial trigger of the workflow method.\r\n\r\n[Needs verification] Query documentation should also probably get the same clarifications because there are situations when a query has to be processed before the first successful WFT.\r\n\r\nRelated to a discussion under a user request in a community slack: https://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTT84KXK9/p1636375128042600\r\n","closedAt":"2021-11-30T19:36:59Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-11-10T18:19:12Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":7,"title":"1.6.0","description":"","dueOn":"2021-12-07T00:00:00Z"},"number":864,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Improve documentation for Signal Methods","updatedAt":"2021-12-06T06:02:28Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/864"}
