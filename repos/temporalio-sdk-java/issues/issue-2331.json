Basically, the latest release of GHA’s Runner agent ignores the fact that an action is requesting node16, and instead just calls node20 anyway. \r\n\r\nUntil now, we were relying on an older GLIBC 2.27-based runner to ensure that the native artifacts of the Test Server would run on some older Linux distros that some of our customers were still using.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that Node20 is incompatible with GLIBC 2.27 or earlier, this should no longer work. We may get some extra time to resolve this issue, as it is believed that the buildjet runner image we currently use may not be immediately updated to the newer GHA runner software, but it is expected that our release workflows may start failing in the very near future.\r\n","closedAt":"2024-12-02T05:20:17Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-11-26T23:11:34Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":2331,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] CI build will soon get broken due to GHA dropping support for node16-based actions","updatedAt":"2024-12-02T05:20:17Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2331"}
