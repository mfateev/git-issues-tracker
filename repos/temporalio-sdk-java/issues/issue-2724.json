Please describe.**\n\n- As mentioned in https://community.temporal.io/t/spring-boot-starter-behavior-changes-on-app-startup/12239/6 ; when the spring application fails to connect to temporal server, the spring application fails to start.\n\n- Temporal is _Not_ a hard dependency for some applications to remain available, this is preventing my application from starting if temporal is unavailable.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nAllow configuration to still allow spring application startup, even when temporal is down.\n\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Open to suggestions here. Not sure about feasibility of conditionally scanning for worker / activity beans based on temporal availability.\n\n\n**Additional context**\n\nSee https://community.temporal.io/t/spring-boot-starter-behavior-changes-on-app-startup/12239/6\n","closedAt":"2025-11-10T17:15:36Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-11-10T16:00:24Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2724,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":5}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Allow Configuration Option to Enable Spring Application Startup Even When Temporal is Unavailable","updatedAt":"2025-11-10T17:15:36Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2724"}
