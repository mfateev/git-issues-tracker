Please describe.**\r\nWe have some use cases where we leverage ApplicationFailure.nonRetryableError for some failures that we expect to happen from an activity.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, we don’t want these failures to be logged as error. Since we also use a service like Sentry for exception monitoring in our prod services, these expected activity failures will pollute the log and would prefer to only log unexpected failures.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSome approach to customize activity failure error logging.\r\nMaxim's proposal was to create a logger per error type as described in here: https://community.temporal.io/t/java-sdk-allow-exception-logging-to-be-customizable-for-activity-failures/2887\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAn alternative I've considered was to never let expected failures to cause an `ApplicationFailure` but to model this into a return type.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2025-10-04T14:17:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM492Iwh","author":{"login":"mfateev"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"My current view is that we should add a flag (or separate method for creation) to allow creating an ApplicationFailure that is not logged.
