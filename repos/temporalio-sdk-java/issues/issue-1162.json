It works great, but we get a LOT of workflow spans getting marked as an error for `DestroyWorkflowThreadError`.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, this is an internal error that the SDK uses for thread cleanup, and does NOT indicate a failure in the workflow. \r\n\r\nThis appears to be a bug, as the code catches `Throwable` here (and isn't catching `Throwable` or `Error` a no-no?):  [OpenTracingWorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-opentracing/src/main/java/io/temporal/opentracing/internal/OpenTracingWorkflowInboundCallsInterceptor.java#L73)\r\n\r\nA naïve approach may be to only catch `Exception` to `logFail`... but I'm not sure if y'all will want (or need) to do something different for `Error` classes.","closedAt":"2022-04-22T17:56:11Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-04-21T17:34:32Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQx","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":{"number":13,"title":"1.11.0","description":"","dueOn":"2022-05-02T00:00:00Z"},"number":1162,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Open Tracing interceptor logs failure for internal temporal errors","updatedAt":"2022-04-22T17:56:11Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1162"}
