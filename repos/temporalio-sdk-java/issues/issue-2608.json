Create a meter-registry-customer, e.g. adding tags:\n```\n@Configuration\npublic class CustomMetricsConfiguration {\n\n  @Value(\"${spring.application.name}\")\n  private String applicationName;\n\n  @Bean\n  public <T extends MeterRegistry> MeterRegistryCustomizer<T> metricsCommonTags() {\n    return registry -> registry.config().commonTags(\n        \"application\", applicationName\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n  2. See that custom tags won't be present in metrics, e.g. by going to /actuator/metrics endpoint\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: 1.28.4\n  - Platform: temporal-spring-boot\n","closedAt":"2025-07-30T15:55:50Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM66-bli","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is already been fixed in `1.30.0` please make sure you are using the latest SDK ","createdAt":"2025-07-30T15:55:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2608#issuecomment-3136928098","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-07-30T14:42:41Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":2608,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"NonRootBeanPostProcessor causes meter-registry eager init","updatedAt":"2025-07-30T15:55:50Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2608"}
