This is unlike Go SDKs that defaults task failures to `WORKFLOW_TASK_FAILED_CAUSE_WORKFLOW_WORKER_UNHANDLED_FAILURE`. We should change to the latter in these cases where it is usually user exception (also see same issue in Core: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/issues/1041).","closedAt":"2025-11-12T18:20:56Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-10-21T18:32:39Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2705,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Default task failure cause to \"workflow worker unhandled failure\"","updatedAt":"2025-11-12T18:20:56Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2705"}
