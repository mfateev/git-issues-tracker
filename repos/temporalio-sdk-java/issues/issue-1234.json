  "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nRight now users who want to export metrics into Prometheus have to implement a scrape endpoint to publish metrics from micrometer reporter following one of the ways described here: https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/learningpaths/application-observability/exposing-metrics-java-prometheus/\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nFor the convenience of users, Temporal JavaSDK should have a built-in implementation of a scrape endpoint for prometheus. This endpoint should allow port/url configuration to be passed to avoid any port conflicts with other instances of scraping endpoints that may be running on the host.\r\n",
