Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, we allocate a lot of physical threads to perform blocking gRPC long poll requests. This doesn't make sense as it creates a lot of semi-active threads with a lot of context switching that just does a blocking io inside.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should have two threads for Pollers. One for Workflow Task Pollers, one for Activity Task Pollers. They should handle all corresponding long poll requests in an async manner.","closedAt":"2025-06-11T20:30:47Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-09-25T20:12:41Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1456,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Pollers should use just one thread to perform async gRPC requests","updatedAt":"2025-06-11T20:30:47Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1456"}
