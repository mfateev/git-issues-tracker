Please describe.**\r\n`SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionCommandAttributes.ChildWorkflowOnly` is not exposed as a part of any JavaSDK API.\r\nIt's also not in the parameters of signal interceptors.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWe should productize on how this flag should be exposed to the user's code. A specific usecase when settings this flag to true is also needed and will be helpful for documentation purposes.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nParity between SDKs. Go and Typescript SDKs expose this flag as a part of their interceptor implementations.\r\n",
