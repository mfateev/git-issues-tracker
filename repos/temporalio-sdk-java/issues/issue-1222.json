Some brief message that the server is not running, listening on the specified port and is ready to handle requests would be very useful. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for considering those improvements. :)\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2022-05-17T21:11:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5DUBQO","author":{"login":"Spikhalskiy"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"<command> is \"./temporal-test-server\" itself.
