Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, an exception that is thrown from a workflow method fails the workflow. In a lot of cases, it is not desirable. For example, a NullPointerException usually means a bug that should be fixed. After the bug is fixed manual steps like reset are needed to restart workflows that failed. \r\n\r\nAn Error thrown from a workflow method already doesn't fail workflow, but fails a decision task, essentially blocking the workflow execution until the error is fixed. As soon as the error is fixed (usually through a code deployment) the workflows continue from the place they were blocked without any additional manual intervention.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe proposal is to change the default behavior to block workflow not only on Error, but also on any exception which is not specified in the \"FailList\".\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nKeep the current behavior and rely on reset to restart failed workflows.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2020-11-25T01:49:54Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2020-07-09T17:17:51Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":146,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Block workflow instead of failing on unexpected exceptions","updatedAt":"2020-11-25T01:49:54Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/146"}
