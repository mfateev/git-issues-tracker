Please describe.**\nI would like to fetch active running workflows through schedule describe call. \nThe problem is `scheduleDescription.getInfo().getRunningActions();` returns list of [ScheduleActionExecution](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/schedules/ScheduleActionExecution.java) object, which doesn't have workflow id and workflow run id, so I need to cast it to [ScheduleActionExecutionStartWorkflow](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/master/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/schedules/ScheduleActionExecutionStartWorkflow.java#L6) to fetch these values. \n```\n ScheduleDescription scheduleDescription = scheduleClient.getHandle(\"scheduleId\").describe();\n        var runningActions = scheduleDescription.getInfo().getRunningActions();\n        var workflowIds = new ArrayList<String>();\n        for (var runningAction : runningActions) {\n            if (runningAction instanceof ScheduleActionExecutionStartWorkflow execution) {\n                workflowIds.add(execution.getWorkflowId());\n            } else {\n                throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unexpected runningAction : \" + runningAction + \"; type: \" + runningAction.getClass());\n            }\n        }\n        return workflowIds;\n```\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nWe should add `getWorkflowId` and `getFirstExecutionRunId` abstract methods in `ScheduleActionExecution`, so we don't need to cast at all and it can be easily supported if some inheritance or something else changes with these 2 classes. \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nWe have tried to cast `ScheduleActionExecution` into `ScheduleActionExecutionStartWorkflow` to fetch the values, and use them. It's not cleaner though. \n","closedAt":"2025-06-13T03:18:50Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM6w9Ulj","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"`ScheduleActionExecution ` is an interface to represent a generic action.
