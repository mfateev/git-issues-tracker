This can happen if the update took longer then the servers long poll deadline request deadline was longer then the servers long poll deadline. This is undesirable since from the user perspective they did not wait on any future so the exception being wrapped in a `ExecutionException` is unexpected.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/806eab71f2b65f762cdd1c4079d3fbad0b62ae1d/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/WorkflowStubImpl.java#L307","closedAt":"2024-01-22T18:23:36Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-19T18:45:27Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":1973,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"WorkflowUpdateException incorrectly wrapped by ExecutionException in some edge case","updatedAt":"2024-01-22T18:23:37Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1973"}
