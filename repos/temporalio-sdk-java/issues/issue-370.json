Please describe.**\r\nFrom a[ forum post:](https://community.temporal.io/t/activities-requiring-different-options/752)\r\n\r\n> Hello, Temporal!\r\nI have an activity interface that defines three different (but related) activities, and each requires different options to be specified (e.g., timeouts). From the Java documentation:\r\nActivity options are needed only if some of the required timeouts are not specified through the @ActivityMethod annotation.\r\nThis seems to suggest that @ActivityMethod annotations could be used to specify different options for each activity in a common interface. At the moment, it looks like ActivityMethod.java only supports overriding of the activity’s name.\r\nSo, is the only option for achieving different timeouts for different activities to instantiate multiple activity stubs within a workflow (each with its own ActivityOptions instance? And in this case, would distinct task queues be required for each stub?\r\nThanks!\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSupport per activity type options when configuring activity stub instance. Consider adding ActivityOptions annotation to the activity method.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nKeep the current implementation that would require a separate stub per activity type.\r\n","closedAt":"2021-04-27T02:29:05Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-03-01T01:39:41Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":370,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add per method activity options","updatedAt":"2021-04-27T02:29:05Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/370"}
