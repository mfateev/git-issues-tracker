Please describe.**\r\nWorker is created with an immutable `WorkerOptions`.\r\nIf there is a need to change some minor parameter of a Worker, the only solution is to stop the whole `WorkflowFactory` and recreate the workers from scratch.\r\nThis is unnecessarily expensive for any frequent usage because it causes disruptions in in-flight activities, and also it evicts the existing workflow cache because the cache belongs to a worker factory.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nTemporal SDK should provide a way to gracefully replace an existing Worker with a new worker with new WorkerOptions without stopping the factory.\r\nIt can be something like\r\n```java\r\nWorkerFactory {\r\n  ...\r\n  Worker shutdownAndRecreateWorker(Worker existingWorker, @Nullable WorkerOptions newOptions)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthat would stop pulling on the existing worker, replace it with a new one, and would allow an old worker to gracefully finish all the processing and stop after that.","closedAt":"2025-05-13T22:07:19Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5aZ389","author":{"login":"Spikhalskiy"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Subtask of #1230","createdAt":"2023-04-20T17:59:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/966#issuecomment-1516732221","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM6ri9OQ","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as this is currently not supported in any other SDK and not currently planned","createdAt":"2025-05-13T22:07:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/966#issuecomment-2878067600","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-01-12T01:03:09Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":12,"title":"Next","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":966,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Provide a way to recreate workers on a started WorkerFactory","updatedAt":"2025-05-13T22:07:20Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/966"}
