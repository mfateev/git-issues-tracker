One option that is commonly used is to set the `failWorkflowExceptionTypes` in order to throw an exception from the workflow that will not be retried. In this case, there is not an easy way to configure this same behavior for testing.\r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by adding a WorkflowImplementationOptions property to TestWorkflowExtension and its builder to be used in `beforeEach` when calling `worker.registerWorkflowImplementationTypes`. Using a default value of `WorkflowImplementationOptions.newBuilder().build()` will preserve the existing behavior if no value is provided.","closedAt":"2023-12-06T22:00:05Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5t5YR2","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is already implemented and will be included in the next Java SDK release\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/commit/bb43d3757fa50c32547da6d26d7f557390ed877d","createdAt":"2023-12-06T22:00:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1953#issuecomment-1843758198","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-12-06T19:21:24Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1953,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add WorkflowImplementationOptions to TestWorkflowExtension","updatedAt":"2023-12-06T22:00:06Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1953"}
