Please describe.**\r\nUsing `WorkflowImplementationOptions`, we can configure default values for `ActivityOptions`. This allows settings these values from by configuration and not injecting or passing configuration objects into the workflow implementations. We'd like to be able to accomplish the same for `WorkflowOptions`. I.e., set the `WorkflowOptions` per workflow in a general location and not only where the workflow stub is created and executed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nSomething like allowing `WorkerOptions` to be set with default `WorkflowOptions` per workflow (if technically possible of course).\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nInjecting configuration options to any code which creates a workflow stub.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","closedAt":"2022-09-27T07:11:03Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5LDAi_","author":{"login":"Spikhalskiy"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's not possible with the current design, WorkflowOptions have to be defined at the workflow start BEFORE the workflow ever gets dispatched to the worker. So, Workflow Worker can't decide WorkflowOptions, it may only provide a subset of the settings using WorkflowImplementationOptions. In the same way, Activity Worker can't define ActivityOptions.\r\n\r\nThe problem and intention are clear though and we work on a new component that will solve this problem as a part of its broader functionality.","createdAt":"2022-09-27T07:11:03Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1464#issuecomment-1259079871","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-09-27T06:37:24Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDODN12PM7NRayD","name":"wontfix","description":"This will not be worked on","color":"BFD4F2"}],"milestone":null,"number":1464,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Allow setting WorkflowOptions via WorkflowImplementationOptions","updatedAt":"2022-09-27T07:12:38Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1464"}
