So it's expected to only increment this on worker-side task fail.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nIn Java, unlike Go, we _also_ increment this on server-side task completion rejection (e.g. `UNHANDLED_COMMAND`). We should have some way to differentiate worker-side task failure and server-side task rejection. In Go we don't even have a metric for the latter, we just log. We should either stop incrementing in this case or we should introduce a label to let the different situations be differentiated.","closedAt":"2023-10-10T21:10:47Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-10-06T13:55:27Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":1885,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Metric temporal_workflow_task_execution_failed is unexpectedly incremented on server-side task completion send failure","updatedAt":"2023-10-10T21:10:47Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1885"}
