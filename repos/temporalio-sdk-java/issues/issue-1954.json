You'd never be able to properly test multiple schedules or an overlapping schedule because they test server doesn't support concurrent, independent workflow runs (time skipping is server-wide not per workflow). We can hack it, but arguably it'd just be more confusing explaining all the ways it isn't the same as a real server.","createdAt":"2023-12-11T18:36:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1954#issuecomment-1850663857","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5uTyXq","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"The time skipping test server is meant to cover testing individual workflow not features like schedules, it would require a complete re do of schedules in Java for little gain vs using a real server.\r\n\r\nGoing to close since we have no plans to do this.","createdAt":"2023-12-11T18:46:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1954#issuecomment-1850680810","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-12-11T16:24:53Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1954,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"TemporalTestServer add support to test schedules","updatedAt":"2023-12-11T18:46:50Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1954"}
