  "body": "# Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nUsers calling `Workflow.continueAsNew` without an explicit `ContinueAsNewOptions` expect most workflow properties to carry over to the new run.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nRight now `continueAsNew` is implemented in a way that assumes that most parameters are carried over by the server if not specified on the continueAsNew request. While in fact, it's the opposite. Server doesn't carry over most parameters are not carried over by the server.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis task requires also \r\n- a careful alignment with GoSDK \r\n- documenting in Temporal API repo which parameters are carried over by the Server from the previous run.\r\n- Test server should be updated to be aligned in its behavior with the real Temporal Server.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n- [x] #1200\r\n- [ ] Workflow RetryOptions are not carried forward automatically",
