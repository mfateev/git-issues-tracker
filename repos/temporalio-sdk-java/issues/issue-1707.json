Please describe.**\r\nSome users experience issues with replays of long workflow histories.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWhile this process will always inherently has O(n) complexity and there is not much that we can do with that, there is one low hanging fruit to improve it.\r\nCurrently `ServiceWorkflowHistoryIterator` requests the next page only when the worker is already blocked and finished processing the previous page. It may be optimized by requesting the next page immediately.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nSee `io.temporal.client.EagerPaginator` and it's implementations where such an approach and logic are already implemented.\r\n",
