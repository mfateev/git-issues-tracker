Please describe.**\r\nIn our testing environment we create new environments for each pull request to allow easy testing, but currently there is no way to utilize the worker auto-discovery feature and have a dynamic queue name.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would recommend that the `@WorkflowImpl` and `@ActivityImpl` annotations allow for spring property placeholders to be used for the `taskQueues` property value.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\napplication-prprofile.yaml\r\n```yml\r\ntask-queue:\r\n  suffix: \"-test-suffix\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@WorkflowImpl(taskQueues = \"my-task-queue${task-queue.suffix:}\")\r\npublic class MyWorkflowImpl implements MyWorkflow { ... }\r\n```\r\nThis will result in the \"my-task-queue-test-suffix\" worker being created when the application is started with the `prprofile` spring profile active and, in other environments, the worker would be created as simply \"my-task-queue\"\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe workaround without this is to no longer use the auto configuration and to configure the task queue names in spring configuration and utilize the property placeholder values there, but this seems like an easy and relatively harmless way to provide the same functionality while still enabling worker auto-configuration\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nN/A\r\n","closedAt":"2023-05-02T01:17:45Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-04-28T21:49:58Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1759,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Allow property placeholders in @ActivityImpl and @WorkflowImpl task queue name","updatedAt":"2023-05-02T01:17:45Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1759"}
