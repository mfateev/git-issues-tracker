Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, JavaSDK creates one sticky queue per Workflow factory and one sticky poller is shared between all the workers. \r\nThis creates several problems:\r\n- Inability to rate limit WFT\r\n- Inability to implement backpressure from each worker, because it will delay sticky queue for all workers\r\n- Inability to prioritize sticky queue over the normal queue processing\r\n- Other complexities with resources isolation\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA sticky queue and poller per each worker.\r\nThis will also open the road to implement the same backpressure semantic we have for activities when pollers don't poll until there is an available processing slot to address #760 \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe counter added in #997 should be reworked to a more strict reporting of a semaphore value, which will be possible after addressing this task.","closedAt":"2022-09-16T16:58:09Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-01-24T02:17:04Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":19,"title":"1.17.0","description":"","dueOn":"2022-09-26T00:00:00Z"},"number":998,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Bring Pollers & Workers on par with Core and Go implementations","updatedAt":"2022-09-16T16:58:09Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/998"}
