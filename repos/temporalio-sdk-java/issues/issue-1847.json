This was just a miss in the typed search attribute PR because it was mostly done before schedules was merged.\r\n\r\nAnother more annoying behaviour is typed search attributes on the schedule workflow action: \r\n* If a user uses the old, deprecated way of setting search attributes when creating a schedule, Java SDK just ignores them when creating the schedule. \r\n* If a users set the SA through both the deprecated and typed way we just accept the typed values and don't error or warn like we do in other places in the Java SDK. \r\n* On the describe path Java SDK will panic if the search attributes does not type information in their metadata. Java always writes this, but other SDKs like Go did not (we would warn in this case) and the server does not currently fill this information in like was expected.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2023-08-28T14:02:44Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-08-24T14:07:29Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":1847,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Typed search attributes aren't consistent with schedules","updatedAt":"2023-08-28T14:02:44Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1847"}
