Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now metrics that are provided by JavaSDK don't give a direct answer to a question of what percentage of WTF, Activity, or Local Activity executors threads are actually used. \r\nWe have a metric that gives us time between SCHEDULE and PULL of the task (SCHEDULE_TO_START) that can be judged that there are not enough Pollers.\r\nWe have a metric that gives us information on how long does it take to process a task (execution_latency)\r\nBut we don't have any direct stats helping to understand that we don't have enough executors. We can theoretically have an underloaded host with not enough executor threads and no metric to understand that we utilize the executor pool fully and we should increase its size.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nReport a gauge metric with a number of available threads in Executor ThreadPools.\r\n","closedAt":"2022-01-24T18:30:25Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-01-19T01:01:43Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":9,"title":"1.8.0","description":"","dueOn":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z"},"number":986,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add metrics for active executors threads","updatedAt":"2022-01-24T18:30:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/986"}
