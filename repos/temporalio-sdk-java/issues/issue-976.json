It's usually some wrappers around the raw gRPC endpoints that are too non-intuitive for users.\r\nWe don't implement this functionality as a normal SDK API because it's not a part of normal Workflow implementations and they don't below to `WorkflowClient` interface. At the same time, we don't have any other class/interface to expose it on and there is no system in place to make this process manageable. \r\nSDK should systematize and expose such functionality and provide a reasonable structure of interfaces and classes to access it.\r\n\r\n# Tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] #1036\r\n\r\n\r\n# Related user requests / reports\r\n\r\n- [x] #835\r\n- [ ] describeWorkflowExecution.
