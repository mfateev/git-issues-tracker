We have seen a potential case where a user _may_ have set invalid utf-8 in a proto `Failure` `message`. We need to confirm whether Java proto library even allows this (in either direction if possible, but especially at marshal time), and then assess our options.","closedAt":"2024-06-12T21:38:55Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM6A-zUv","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Confirmed the java proto library does not allow non-utf8 proto string","createdAt":"2024-06-12T21:38:55Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2106#issuecomment-2163946799","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-06-11T17:41:09Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2106,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Confirm non-utf8 proto string behavior","updatedAt":"2024-06-12T21:38:55Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2106"}
