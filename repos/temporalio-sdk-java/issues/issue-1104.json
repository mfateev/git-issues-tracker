I suspect this might be related to the `/undefined/` path segment added to the URL when following search results, as this path segment does not appear in the URL otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Browse to [the latest API doc for the Temporal Java SDK](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.temporal/temporal-sdk/latest/index.html)\r\n  2. Click the **Search** box near the upper-right corner\r\n  3. Enter **`RetryOptions`** in the box (though any class or method would also demonstrate the problem)\r\n  4. Click any of the matching results\r\n  5. Observe the AccessDenied error similar to the screenshot below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2183904/160472950-39be4655-9ed4-4656-a22f-19421aeb511d.png)\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: Firefox, version 91.7.1esr (64-bit), but likely not browser-specific\r\n  - Platform: Mac OS Monterey 12.2.1 (21D62), but likely not platform-specific\r\n","closedAt":"2022-03-28T19:35:37Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5Ab6bX","author":{"login":"Spikhalskiy"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Already addressed in #1078","createdAt":"2022-03-28T19:35:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1104#issuecomment-1081059031","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-03-28T19:33:41Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":1104,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Permissions Error for Links Followed via javadoc.io Search","updatedAt":"2022-03-28T19:35:51Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1104"}
