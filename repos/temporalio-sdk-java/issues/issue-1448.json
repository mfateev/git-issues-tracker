This enables applications to block a thread while waiting for some I/O to complete, without actually blocking any underlying OS thread. It seems like this would have big benefits for the Java SDK, since it currently does block OS threads while I/O is happening, and requires quite a bit of implementation complexity to evict those blocked threads from the cache, as well as carrying a performance penalty.\r\n\r\nAre there plans to try to support this feature in the SDK? Obviously it is still a bit early, since the feature is just a preview right now, but it seems like it's worth looking into, given the potential benefits.","closedAt":"2024-11-04T05:13:07Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM6MudOL","author":{"login":"s-aliasgar"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Now that Virtual Threads is a full-fledged feature in java https://openjdk.org/jeps/444\r\nCan it please be adopted in Java-SDK","createdAt":"2024-09-19T13:27:31Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1448#issuecomment-2360988555","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-09-20T16:07:19Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1448,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":25}},{"content":"EYES","users":{"totalCount":5}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support for virtual threads (project Loom)","updatedAt":"2024-11-04T05:13:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1448"}
