Please describe.**\nWe want to differentiate between workflows triggered by a schedule automatically vs manually (e.g., from a dashboard or API). While `TemporalScheduledStartTime` helps distinguish scheduled vs manual triggers in some cases, there’s currently no way to know **who** or **what service** triggered a manual run via `ScheduleHandle.trigger()` or via interceptor `ScheduleClientCallsInterceptor.CreateScheduleInput`\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nAdding a metadata field like `trigger_source`, `client_identity`, or similar\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nWe currently plan to compare `nextActionTime` with actual workflow start time and set a `trigger_type` search attribute manually. \n\n**Additional context**\nAttaching slack thread :- https://temporaltechnologies.slack.com/archives/C076CB0E075/p1747790772423569","closedAt":"2025-05-27T20:32:10Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM6tr4b0","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"To can set the identity for the schedule client in the [ScheduleClientOptions.Builder](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/0b885071ba07bebf9b53adccd0f8e9d7b1c9d42a/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/client/schedules/ScheduleClientOptions.java#L79).
