New version is missing `WorkflowExecutionUtils.describeWorkflowInstance()` method. As I've checked - it was still available in 1.3.1, but during refactoring of `WorkflowExecutionUtils` in 1.4.0 it was removed. \r\n\r\nWhy was it removed? Is there an alternative to get workflow execution status?\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nWorkflowExecutionUtils.describeWorkflowInstance() is available\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nWorkflowExecutionUtils.describeWorkflowInstance() is missing \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n\r\n  1. Use version 1.1.0 of temporalio/sdk-java\r\n  1. Use WorkflowExecutionUtils.describeWorkflowInstance() somewhere in your code\r\n  1. Update temporalio/sdk-java to version 1.8.0\r\n  1. Try to compile your code\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.8.0\r\n  - Platform: Linux\r\n","closedAt":"2022-02-03T15:22:42Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM49VtVe","author":{"login":"Spikhalskiy"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"`io.temporal.internal.common.WorkflowExecutionUtils` is an internal class and you shouldn't be using it in the first place.\r\nInternal classes get refactored without any consideration for users who may be using them.\r\nThis method is right now located in `io.temporal.internal.client.WorkflowClientHelper`, but it can be removed any time again from there because it's still an internal class.\r\n\r\nThis is the implementation of this method that you can drop in your project if you need it, it's a trivial API call.\r\n```\r\n  public static WorkflowExecutionInfo describeWorkflowInstance(\r\n      WorkflowServiceStubs service,\r\n      String namespace,\r\n      WorkflowExecution workflowExecution) {\r\n    DescribeWorkflowExecutionRequest describeRequest =\r\n        DescribeWorkflowExecutionRequest.newBuilder()\r\n            .setNamespace(namespace)\r\n            .setExecution(workflowExecution)\r\n            .build();\r\n    DescribeWorkflowExecutionResponse executionDetail =\r\n        service\r\n            .blockingStub()\r\n            .describeWorkflowExecution(describeRequest);\r\n    return executionDetail.getWorkflowExecutionInfo();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may productize and expose an official SDK API for these kinds of calls as a part of https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/976 effort, but for now, you should be using the gRPC stubs directly.\r\n\r\nPlease use [Temporal Forum](https://community.temporal.io/) or [Temporal Slack](https://temporal.io/slack) for questions.","createdAt":"2022-02-03T15:22:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1028#issuecomment-1029100894","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-02-03T15:17:06Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ4","name":"question","description":"Further information is requested","color":"BFD4F2"},{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTgwNzE1ODU0","name":"invalid","description":"This doesn't seem right","color":"e4e669"}],"milestone":null,"number":1028,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Missing WorkflowExecutionUtils.describeWorkflowInstance()","updatedAt":"2022-02-03T15:38:11Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1028"}
