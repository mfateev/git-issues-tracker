Please describe.**\r\nWhen implementing a DSL or a generic starter it might be needed to call a typed workflow or activity passing a matching JSON as input. Currently, it is not possible to use the high level APIs as they will pass this JSON as a string. Then receiving workflow or activity would fail to deserialize it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI propose to allow application code to pass Payloads as an activity or workflow argument. In this case, the default DataConverter would not look into its content and return it as it is. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAsk users to implement their custom DataConverter.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCommunity [thread](https://community.temporal.io/t/rest-api-like-tctl-workflow-start/4402) about this issue.\r\n","closedAt":"2025-05-15T02:24:02Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM6ryETX","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We added this support with the addition of `RawValues`","createdAt":"2025-05-15T02:24:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1126#issuecomment-2882028759","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-04-10T17:21:12Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1126,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add pass through for Payloads to the default DataConverter","updatedAt":"2025-05-15T02:24:03Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1126"}
