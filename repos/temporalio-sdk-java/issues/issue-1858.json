This can cause the worker to get stuck only polling the stick task queue if all the pollers are polling the sticky queue and all the WFT get moved to the normal task queue.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/blob/b7931cbfb1de6e5797a0dded2163b63d8a5836e8/internal/internal_task_pollers.go#L770\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n  - Version: 1.21.1\r\n  - Platform: Mac OS\r\n","closedAt":"2023-09-07T16:09:24Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-09-07T14:05:56Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":1858,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Worker can get stuck only polling sticky queue","updatedAt":"2023-09-07T16:09:24Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1858"}
