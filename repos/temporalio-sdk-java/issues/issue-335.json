Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to get a list of queries and signals a workflow is listening on. So UI has to emit an unsupported query and parse the list of supported ones from the message. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAdd a query that would return metadata about workflow. Lists of supported queries and signals should be included into the result.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUse worker query (not implemented yet) instead. But as the set of queries and signals that workflow accepts is dynamic a normal query would make more sense.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n[An error is logged by the service ](https://community.temporal.io/t/io-temporal-internal-sync-syncworkflowcontext-query-uncategorized-exception-often-seen-in-server-log/1454)every time UI needs to find out the list of supported queries.\r\n\r\nThe query should be supported by all SDKs.","closedAt":"2024-11-19T15:33:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5yuQB5","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"See https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/51","createdAt":"2024-02-02T21:29:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/335#issuecomment-1924726905","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-02-06T20:49:10Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":335,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Support workflow metadata query","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T15:33:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/335"}
