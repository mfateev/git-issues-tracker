Temporal provides all the information needed for that already. But Temporal shouldn't frame it as a good practice and provide a unit test tooling for it.","createdAt":"2022-05-06T18:54:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1189#issuecomment-1119923566","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-05-06T18:18:27Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDODN12PM7NRayD","name":"wontfix","description":"This will not be worked on","color":"BFD4F2"}],"milestone":null,"number":1189,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Expose assertHistoryEvent utility method from TestWorkflowRule","updatedAt":"2022-05-09T17:53:20Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1189"}
