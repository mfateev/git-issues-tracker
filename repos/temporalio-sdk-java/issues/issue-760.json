Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now the WFT polling logic is to always poll first, then try to send the task to the processing executor. If there is a significant imbalance or misconfiguration of pollers/executors, it can cause significant delays and backlog of WFT.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nPoller should pause polling in this case until a processing thread is freed up.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nScaling by decreasing the number of pollers or increasing the number of worker threads. This requires manual work that doesn't have to be needed and it's also a static solution that can't adjust to dynamic changes in a workload.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nSimilar change was implemented earlier for Activities: #286\r\n","closedAt":"2022-09-16T04:55:28Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5KcPvT","author":{"login":"Spikhalskiy"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Closed by #1431","createdAt":"2022-09-16T04:55:28Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/760#issuecomment-1248918483","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-09-23T17:33:14Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":19,"title":"1.17.0","description":"","dueOn":"2022-09-26T00:00:00Z"},"number":760,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Implement Workflow Tasks backpressure for Pollers if there is no available executors","updatedAt":"2022-09-16T04:55:29Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/760"}
