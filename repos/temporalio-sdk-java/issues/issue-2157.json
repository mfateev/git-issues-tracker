However, the latest release of GitHub's Runner Agent brings in new dependencies that are incompatible with Ubuntu 18.04, forcing immediate update of all Runners.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore urgent that we update our CI workflows to use a more recent runner, as we might be incapable of making a new Java SDK release until this is fixed.","closedAt":"2024-12-03T05:31:49Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-07-29T19:24:02Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":2157,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"CI: Get rid of buildjet-2vcpu-ubuntu-1804 GHA runners","updatedAt":"2024-12-03T05:31:49Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2157"}
