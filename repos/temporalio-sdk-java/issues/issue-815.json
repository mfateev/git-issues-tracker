Please describe.**\r\nWhen worker configured to have multiple pollers, all pollers share one connection and will poll from only one frontend server. This does not work well when worker count is the same or smaller than frontend server count.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThere should have an option to be able to specify how many connections you want for one worker so the load is more evenly distributed among frontend servers. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUser has to start more workers to have the load more evenly distributed across all frontend servers.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2024-09-18T23:26:42Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM6MpPEh","author":{"login":"Quinn-With-Two-Ns"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing as original Go PR was closed in favour of DNS based approach","createdAt":"2024-09-18T23:26:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/815#issuecomment-2359619873","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-10-12T16:09:53Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":815,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Port] Allow multiple host:port to be specified for connection","updatedAt":"2024-09-18T23:26:42Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/815"}
