But if the language doesn't have a wrapper for stubs (like Java does), this method may be on WorkflowClient.\r\n\r\nIssues for other SDKs:\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/595\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/issues/312","closedAt":"2022-04-29T16:36:20Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM44cSRf","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@Spikhalskiy - Will wait on suggested Java signatures before adding to Go.\r\n\r\nTo confirm, are you thinking `healthCheck` just invokes https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/790ce5c97ff3a3922d50a1fd3a4bab91e2bcd435/src/proto/grpc/health/v1/health.proto#L45 for the workflow service, and then returns a boolean? And `isHealthy` returns the boolean based on the client's existing known knowledge (i.e. last health check, not a new one)? We can definitely do both easily in Go.","createdAt":"2021-10-19T17:23:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/828#issuecomment-946938975","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-10-19T16:53:25Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":13,"title":"1.11.0","description":"","dueOn":"2022-05-02T00:00:00Z"},"number":828,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Expose health check on WorkflowServiceStubs or WorkflowClient","updatedAt":"2022-04-29T16:36:20Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/828"}
