Have you guys experienced this/have a good way around this? We use the async activity completion to be able to use Kotlin coroutines in parts of our code. I am trying to get some logs from the team that reported it, but wanted to see if you guys had seen something similar`\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to have a special API for async activity completion from the same process, which is different from the current API which was intended for completion from any process. This new API would perform counting correctly.","closedAt":"2021-01-04T18:50:54Z","comments":[{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMzQwMzI2Ng==","author":{"login":"vitarb"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Make sure that when we implement https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/14 we obey the limit set here.","createdAt":"2020-11-25T01:24:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/70#issuecomment-733403266","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NDE1MDE1OQ==","author":{"login":"vitarb"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Resolved in https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/pull/291","createdAt":"2021-01-04T18:50:54Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/70#issuecomment-754150159","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2020-04-21T17:35:02Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":70,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add support for MaxConcurrentActivityExecutionSize for async activities","updatedAt":"2021-01-04T18:50:55Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/70"}
