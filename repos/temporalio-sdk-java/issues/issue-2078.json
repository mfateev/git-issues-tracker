Please describe.**\r\nIt is assumed that in a single application, there are multiple workers that operate for different queues. Due to internal integrations in our infrastructure, I must specify a queue in the identity property. The worker is created using a `WorkerFactory`, which is linked to a `WorkflowClient`. Currently, there is only the ability to specify identity for the client.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI propose the introduction of an option to assign an identity within `WorkerOptions`, and for this identity to be treated as a priority when `SingleWorkerOptions` are being configured.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/blob/5e5cf0bf2db695cba46d1855959e02b4cdfa3cff/temporal-sdk/src/main/java/io/temporal/worker/Worker.java#L586-L608\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nA possible workaround could involve creating a distinct `WorkflowClient` for every queue, which in turn would necessitate a separate `WorkerFactory` for each. However, employing a single client is fully sufficient for the application's needs.\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2024-05-29T18:28:47Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-28T17:09:03Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjIyNzE5ODQ0","name":"enhancement","description":"User experience","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":2078,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Add the ability to specify worker identity for each worker","updatedAt":"2024-05-29T18:28:47Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2078"}
