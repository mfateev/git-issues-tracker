Please describe.**\n\nWhen I call `WorkflowStub.cancel` I want to only target the workflow execution I used to create the stub and not the latest workflow.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nAdd overload for `WorkflowStub.cancel` to target exact workflow execution instead of the latest workflow ID/execution chain\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nWe could also look at setting `first_execution_run_id`, need to verify if it is properly implemented for cancel.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nWe need to add an appropriate note/warning to this overload since targeting such a specific run can be flaky when using things like continue as new.
