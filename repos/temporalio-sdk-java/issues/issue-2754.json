However this path is not being read (the Linux path is being read instead `~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml`)\n\n## Actual Behavior\nOn a mac I expect the SDK to read the Environment Config profile from $HOME/Library/Application Support/temporalio/temporal.toml\n\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\n\n  1. Create a Profile TOML file on a Mac using the CLI, which writes a file to: $HOME/Library/Application Support/temporalio/temporal.toml\n  1. Create a Java program that attempts to read the Profile using the Env Config APIs.  An error will be thrown that the profile cannot be found\n  1. For fun, copy the profile file from the default, documented location ($HOME/Library/Application Support/temporalio/temporal.toml) to ~/.config/temporalio/temporal.toml.  Run the Java program again.  The profile will now be successfully found and loaded\n\n## Specifications\n\n  - Version: Java SDK 1.32.1\n  - Platform: Mac\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2026-01-04T17:49:02Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":2754,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"Environment Configuration does not read the correct file path on macOS","updatedAt":"2026-01-11T17:17:01Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/2754"}
