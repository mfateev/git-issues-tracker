There is no corresponding WorkflowInfo method to retrieve this information from running workflow. This makes memo pretty useless when using Temporal Java SDK.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n1.0.7\r\n\r\nConversation in Slack:\r\nhttps://temporalio.slack.com/archives/CTT84KXK9/p1622042440064800\r\n","closedAt":"2021-08-26T20:29:59Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-05-26T19:22:47Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":512,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Missing getMemo functionality in WorkflowInfo","updatedAt":"2021-08-26T20:29:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/512"}
