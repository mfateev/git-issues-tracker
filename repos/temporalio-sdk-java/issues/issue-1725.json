It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.</p>\n<p>Library home page: <a href=\"https://urielch.github.io/\">https://urielch.github.io/</a></p>\n<p>Path to dependency file: /temporal-spring-boot-starter-alpha/build.gradle</p>\n<p>Path to vulnerable library: /home/wss-scanner/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/net.minidev/json-smart/2.4.8/7c62f5f72ab05eb54d40e2abf0360a2fe9ea477f/json-smart-2.4.8.jar</p>\n<p>\n\nDependency Hierarchy:\n  - temporal-testing-1.20.0-SNAPSHOT (Root Library)\n    - json-path-2.7.0.jar\n      - :x: **json-smart-2.4.8.jar** (Vulnerable Library)\n<p>Found in HEAD commit: <a href=\"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/commit/489b9480700b742795e071c0526460c525dbf044\">489b9480700b742795e071c0526460c525dbf044</a></p>\n<p>Found in base branch: <b>master</b></p>\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n###  Vulnerability Details\n<p>  \n  \n[Json-smart](https://netplex.github.io/json-smart/) is a performance focused, JSON processor lib. When reaching a ‘[‘ or ‘{‘ character in the JSON input, the code parses an array or an object respectively. It was discovered that the code does not have any limit to the nesting of such arrays or objects. Since the parsing of nested arrays and objects is done recursively, nesting too many of them can cause a stack exhaustion (stack overflow) and crash the software.\n\n<p>Publish Date: 2023-03-22\n<p>URL: <a href=https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2023-1370>CVE-2023-1370</a></p>\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n###  CVSS 3 Score Details (<b>7.5</b>)\n<p>\n\nBase Score Metrics:\n- Exploitability Metrics:\n  - Attack Vector: Network\n  - Attack Complexity: Low\n  - Privileges Required: None\n  - User Interaction: None\n  - Scope: Unchanged\n- Impact Metrics:\n  - Confidentiality Impact: None\n  - Integrity Impact: None\n  - Availability Impact: High\n</p>\nFor more information on CVSS3 Scores, click <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0\">here</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n###  Suggested Fix\n<p>\n\n<p>Type: Upgrade version</p>\n<p>Origin: <a href=\"https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/stack-exhaustion-in-json-smart-leads-to-denial-of-service-when-parsing-malformed-json-xray-427633/\">https://research.jfrog.com/vulnerabilities/stack-exhaustion-in-json-smart-leads-to-denial-of-service-when-parsing-malformed-json-xray-427633/</a></p>\n<p>Release Date: 2023-03-22</p>\n<p>Fix Resolution: net.minidev:json-smart:2.4.9</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n</details>","closedAt":"2023-04-21T16:05:24Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM5ae4Ic","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":":heavy_check_mark: This issue was automatically closed by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) was either marked as ignored or it is no longer part of the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2023-04-21T16:05:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1725#issuecomment-1518043676","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-03-30T08:18:39Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDODN12PM7tOe3c","name":"Mend: dependency security vulnerability","description":"Security vulnerability detected by WhiteSource","color":"d1260f"}],"milestone":null,"number":1725,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"temporal-testing-1.20.0-SNAPSHOT: 1 vulnerabilities (highest severity is: 7.5) - autoclosed","updatedAt":"2023-04-21T16:05:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/1725"}
