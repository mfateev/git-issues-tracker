Because from some point of view, it's an admin/cluster operator API and functionality that probably shouldn't be used by the application code at all. \r\nIf this is our officially supported feature of SDK, we should provide an access that doesn't require digging into gRPC stubs and photo Request/Responses. It should be either a call on `WorkflowClient` or another user-facing class like that.","createdAt":"2021-10-22T19:29:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/835#issuecomment-949907738","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDODN12PM44nonn","author":{"login":"akdoan1"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"In that case, I'd also wonder if these types of operations should live on a \"Workflow\"Client or some dedicated admin client to interface with the server or es.
