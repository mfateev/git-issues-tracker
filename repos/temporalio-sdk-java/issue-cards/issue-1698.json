  "summary": "WorkflowImplementationOptions.FailWorkflowExceptionTypes is ignored when the service rejects workflow task completion, causing workflows to get stuck in retry loops instead of failing as expected. Setting an invalid retry policy (e.g., maximumInterval < initialInterval) demonstrates the issue where service failures don't trigger workflow failure.",
