  "summary": "Discussion about whether the Java SDK implements exponential backoff for server polling requests. The author questions whether polling uses fixed intervals rather than exponential backoff, which could impact server load during high-traffic scenarios. A commenter clarifies that exponential backoff is already implemented via GrpcSyncRetryer and BackoffThrottler.",
