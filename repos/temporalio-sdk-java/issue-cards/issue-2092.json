  "rootCause": "The ActivityCompletionClient.complete() method bypasses Temporal's normal completion mechanisms where the metric is recorded, similar to how other SDKs handle async completion.",
  "proposedFix": "Add activity_succeed_endtoend_latency metric reporting to the ManualActivityCompletionClientImpl.complete() method when completing in-process async activities.",
