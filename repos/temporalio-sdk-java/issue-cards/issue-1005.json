  "summary": "Request to add ActivityExecutionContext#isCancelled method to allow activities to check cancellation status without heartbeating. Currently, activities can only detect cancellation through heartbeat exceptions, which is problematic for non-heartbeating and local activities that have no way to be notified of cancellation.",

  "userImpact": "Activities currently lack a clean, non-heartbeat mechanism to detect cancellation, making it difficult to implement proper cancellation handling in local activities and non-heartbeating activities.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK's current cancellation notification design relies exclusively on heartbeat exceptions, which doesn't work for activities that don't heartbeat or for local activities that don't heartbeat at all.",
  "proposedFix": "Add ActivityExecutionContext#isCancelled method as a flag-based alternative to heartbeat exception handling, with a possible additional method returning detailed cancellation reasons.",
