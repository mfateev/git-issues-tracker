  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Java developers cannot easily query for open workflow executions like in the Go SDK, requiring them to use low-level gRPC stubs or query elasticsearch directly.",
  "rootCause": "Java SDK lacks a user-facing API for workflow search queries that other SDKs provide, forcing users to work with raw protobuf entities.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose workflow search functionality through a dedicated API, either on WorkflowClient or a separate admin client, similar to the Go SDK's ListOpenWorkflow.",
  "workaround": "Use gRPC stubs directly with raw protobuf entities or query elasticsearch directly.",

  "keyQuote": "If this is our officially supported feature of SDK, we should provide an access that doesn't require digging into gRPC stubs and proto Request/Responses.",
