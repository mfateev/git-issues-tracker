  "rootCause": "Deadlock detector uses fixed thresholds (>1 second without yielding) during class loading and instrumentation phases, which are inherently slow on cold JVM startup, causing false positives.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement relaxed Deadlock Detector thresholds during worker startup, such as multiplying the detection threshold by N for the first execution of each workflow type.",
