  "userImpact": "Users testing workflows with multiple timers may be confused by automatic time-skipping behavior in TestEnv that differs from documented expectations.",
  "rootCause": "TimeLockingInterceptor enables unlimited time skipping after getResult() is called to simplify test writing, which causes subsequent timers to complete immediately without explicit testEnv.sleep() calls.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Call testEnv.sleep() explicitly for each timer duration instead of relying on getResult() to handle all time advancement.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer clarified this is intentional behavior (not a bug) implemented via TimeLockingInterceptor to remove frustration from unit test writers. When getResult() is called, the framework automatically skips time until workflow completion.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "This is actually not a bug, but a feature. It's implemented in `TimeLockingInterceptor` that is used by default in the test environment.",
