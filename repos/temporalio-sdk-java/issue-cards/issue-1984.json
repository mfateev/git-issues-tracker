  "summary": "Spring Boot Starter lacks ability to customize workflow options by workflow type. Unlike the Java SDK which supports type-specific options via `registerWorkflowImplementationTypes()`, the Spring Boot Starter only allows global customization, preventing workflows like scheduled ones from having different failure handling (e.g., failing on NonDeterministicException) than others.",
