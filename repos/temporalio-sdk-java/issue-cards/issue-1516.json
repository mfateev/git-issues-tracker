Issue was automatically closed when the vulnerable library was removed from the Mend inventory.",

  "severity": "critical",
  "userImpact": "Users of the spring-boot-starter could be vulnerable to remote code execution if untrusted YAML content is deserialized, requiring immediate dependency upgrades.",
  "rootCause": "SnakeYaml Constructor class does not restrict types during deserialization, allowing arbitrary object instantiation from malicious YAML input.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade snakeyaml to version 1.31 or later, or use SnakeYaml's SafeConstructor when parsing untrusted content.",
  "workaround": "Use SafeConstructor instead of Constructor for parsing untrusted YAML content.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was automatically closed by Mend when the vulnerable library was removed from the inventory, indicating the spring-boot-dependencies version was updated to exclude snakeyaml-1.30.",

  "keyQuote": "Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content.",
