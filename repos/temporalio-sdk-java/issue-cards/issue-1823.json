  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users deploying to environments without Temporal need a clean way to disable Temporal beans instead of using workarounds like intentional connection failures.",
  "rootCause": "Spring auto-configuration always attempts to instantiate Temporal beans if the dependency is present, even when not needed in certain environments.",

  "workaround": "Set connection type to 'local' to intentionally fail and prevent service crash.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as Spring provides built-in mechanisms to disable specific auto-configurations, making a separate flag unnecessary.",
