The last scheduled local activity before the heartbeat is not properly tracked, causing the outstanding activity counter to reach zero while work remains pending.",

  "userImpact": "Users experience stuck workflows that appear to be waiting for local activities that are not actually executing, with no automatic recovery.",
  "rootCause": "A `break` statement in ReplayWorkflowRunTaskHandler prevents the last scheduled local activity from being processed by state machines before a heartbeat, causing the outstanding local activities counter to incorrectly reach zero while work remains pending, leading to premature workflow task closure instead of heartbeat.",

  "keyQuote": "Because of a `break` here... this local activity command will never be taken by the state machines and accounted for in the outstanding local activities counter.",
