  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Improves code maintainability and clarity for SDK developers by making complex activity execution logic explicitly modeled rather than hidden in conditional branches.",
  "rootCause": "Self-transitions and conditional logic in state machines obscure the actual state flow and make it difficult to understand and maintain activity execution logic across SDKs.",
  "proposedFix": "Introduce additional states to eliminate self-transitions where events can only be applied once. Convert activity cancellationType from if/else conditions to dedicated states in the state machine model.",

  "keyQuote": "The goal of these changes is to make sure that all of the complex logic related to activity execution is explicitly modeled.",
