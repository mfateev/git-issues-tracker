  "summary": "Feature request to add ARM64 (Mac and Linux) distribution support for temporal-test-server, which is currently only available for AMD64. This is needed to access the start_time_skipping test environment for validating wait_condition behavior on ARM64-based Macs.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "ARM64 Mac users cannot access time-skipping test environment functionality, limiting their ability to validate wait_condition behavior.",
  "rootCause": "temporal-test-server releases only include AMD64 binaries, not ARM64 builds",
  "proposedFix": "Add ARM64 Linux and Mac distribution builds to temporal-test-server releases",
  "workaround": "Run Linux containers with amd64 platform emulation, though this causes compatibility issues with ARM64-dependent packages",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Team confirmed this is a priority and indicated work is underway to change the test server build to support ARM64",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Yes this is something we would like to support, hopefully in the very near future. Currently working on changing the test server build to support this.",
