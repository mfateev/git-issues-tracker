  "summary": "The Java SDK increments the temporal_workflow_task_execution_failed metric on server-side task completion rejection (e.g., UNHANDLED_COMMAND), but this metric should only reflect worker-side failures. Unlike the Go SDK which logs these cases separately, Java needs to either stop incrementing in server-side rejection scenarios or introduce a label to differentiate worker-side failures from server-side rejections.",
