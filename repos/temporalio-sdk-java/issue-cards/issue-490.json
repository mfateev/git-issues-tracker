  "summary": "Feature request to add LocalActivityOption#contextPropagators to support context propagation for local activities, analogous to the existing ActivityOption#contextPropagators API.",

  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot specify custom context propagators for local activities, limiting context propagation capabilities when using local activities with different codebases.",
  "rootCause": "LocalActivityOption API lacks feature parity with ActivityOption for context propagators, and context propagators on ActivityOptions only apply client-side rather than worker-side.",
  "proposedFix": "Add LocalActivityOption#contextPropagators with the same semantic as ActivityOption#contextPropagators, though with awareness of the limited applicability.",
  "workaround": "Specify ContextPropagators on WorkerOptions to apply them for all activities on both caller and worker sides.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Authors concluded that ActivityOption#contextPropagators has extremely limited usage and are only applied client-side. The proper approach is to specify ContextPropagators on WorkerOptions instead, making the feature addition for local activities unnecessary and potentially misleading.",

  "keyQuote": "ActivityOptions#contextPropagators should be used carefully with full understanding that they are applied only to the client/stub side.",
