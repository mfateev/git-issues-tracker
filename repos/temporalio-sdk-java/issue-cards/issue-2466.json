  "rootCause": "Version 1.22.0+ changed Spring Boot starter to fail initialization if server connection cannot be established, removing graceful degradation behavior from older versions.",
  "proposedFix": "Add configuration option to make worker startup non-blocking and allow the application to start successfully even when Temporal server is unavailable, with separate readiness/liveness probe support.",
  "workaround": "Increase `WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.Builder.setSystemInfoTimeout` and start the worker manually after application startup completes.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers determined that workers require active server connection to function and recommended fixing deployment orchestration instead, but acknowledged the microservice pattern concern.",
