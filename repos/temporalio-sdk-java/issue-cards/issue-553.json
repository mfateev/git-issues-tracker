  "summary": "WorkflowReplayer cannot parse workflow history JSON exported by tctl because the event type names differ from what the Java SDK expects. The tctl output uses EVENT_TYPE_ prefixes (e.g., EVENT_TYPE_WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STARTED) while WorkflowReplayer expects names without the prefix (e.g., WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STARTED).",
