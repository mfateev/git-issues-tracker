  "summary": "Activity timeouts are only detectable when heartbeats reach the Temporal server, but heartbeat throttling delays detection. The request proposes having the heartbeat method throw a timeout exception when start-to-close or schedule-to-close timeouts are violated, enabling local timeout detection.",

  "rootCause": "Heartbeat throttling prevents or delays heartbeats from reaching the server, preventing timeout detection in activity code until the server rejects the result.",
