  "summary": "Temporal Java SDK is using an older version of gRPC (grpc-netty-shaded 1.58.x) that contains known vulnerabilities. While the vulnerability (CVE-2025-55163) doesn't directly impact the SDK's client-only usage, users want guidance on upgrading to the latest gRPC version (1.75.0+) and understanding compatibility.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users face security scanning failures and vulnerability reports due to outdated gRPC dependencies, even though the specific vulnerability doesn't affect the Java SDK's client-only usage.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal Java SDK pins an older version of gRPC (1.58.x) through grpc-netty-shaded, and when users upgrade to newer gRPC versions, they encounter classpath conflicts in the testing framework (temporal-testing) which has internal dependencies on older gRPC classes.",
  "proposedFix": "Update gRPC dependency management to the latest version (1.75.0+) and ensure temporal-testing module is compatible with newer gRPC APIs, particularly AbstractServerImplBuilder and related internal classes.",
  "workaround": "Users can use dependencyManagement with scope=import to override the gRPC version: add grpc-bom v1.76.0+ in dependencyManagement with scope=import to ensure consistent gRPC versions across transitive dependencies.",
