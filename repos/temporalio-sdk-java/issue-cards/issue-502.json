  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users integrating with APM systems like DataDog cannot use OpenTracing with Temporal because span naming conventions don't match system expectations.",
  "rootCause": "OpenTracing implementation uses hardcoded span naming strategy (RunWorkflow_<Name>, RunActivity_<Name>) that doesn't align with all APM providers' expectations.",
  "proposedFix": "Create an OperationNameAndTagsProvider interface to allow custom span naming and tagging strategies, with multiple standard implementations (including current default and DataDog-compatible variant).",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Feature was implemented with pluggable strategy interface following the JaxRS/Jersey pattern referenced in discussion.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "It would be great if the OpenTracingOptions provided the ability to completely override the strategy for naming/tagging spans.",
