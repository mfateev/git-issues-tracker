  "userImpact": "Applications using the SDK are exposed to denial of service attacks through specially crafted protobuf messages that trigger extended garbage collection pauses.",
  "rootCause": "Protobuf-java versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6, and 3.16.3 have parsing vulnerabilities that convert messages back-and-forth between mutable and immutable forms, causing long GC pauses.",
