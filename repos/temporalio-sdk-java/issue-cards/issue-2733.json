  "userImpact": "Users receive confusing metrics with unexpected 'none' activity_type values and inconsistent metric reporting, making it difficult to monitor activity scheduling latency accurately.",
  "rootCause": "Activity failures during retry may be generating schedule_to_start_latency metrics without an associated activity_type, resulting in 'none' being used as a default dimension value.",
  "proposedFix": "Either ensure activity_schedule_to_start_latency always reports activity_type dimension for all activities, or remove activity_type dimension entirely and use task_queue as the lowest granularity.",
