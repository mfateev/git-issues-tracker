  "severity": "critical",
  "userImpact": "Applications using the Spring Boot Starter are exposed to remote code execution and denial of service attacks through unsafe YAML deserialization.",
  "rootCause": "SnakeYAML 1.30 Constructor class does not restrict types during deserialization, allowing arbitrary object instantiation from untrusted YAML content.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade Spring Boot Starter to version 3.0.0 or use SnakeYAML's SafeConstructor when parsing untrusted content.",
  "workaround": "Use SnakeYAML SafeConstructor instead of default Constructor for parsing untrusted YAML.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was automatically closed by Mend when the vulnerable library was removed from inventory or marked as ignored.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution.",
