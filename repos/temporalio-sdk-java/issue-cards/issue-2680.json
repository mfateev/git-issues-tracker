  "userImpact": "Spring Boot applications cannot start if Temporal server is unavailable or overloaded, preventing deployments during peak load scenarios and preventing health checks from reporting connection issues.",
  "rootCause": "WorkerFactory.start() synchronously calls SystemInfoInterceptor which makes a blocking gRPC call to getSystemInfo() during application startup, with no timeout configuration flexibility or fallback mechanism.",
  "proposedFix": "Make worker startup non-blocking or add configuration property to enable graceful startup with connection issues reported via health checks instead of failing application startup.",
  "workaround": "Use manual start instead of auto-configuration and configure WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.Builder.setSystemInfoTimeout() to handle timeouts.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Core issue is server overload, not SDK behavior. Workaround provided via manual configuration of SystemInfoTimeout.",
