  "rootCause": "Update handlers are currently run synchronously in their own threads, causing thread pool exhaustion when handling multiple concurrent updates.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a native API similar to ActivityExecutionContext.isUseLocalManualCompletion() that allows update handlers to return a Promise that can be completed asynchronously in another thread.",
  "workaround": "Users can currently implement async updates with existing SDK API but must wait in the thread for results, which doesn't solve the thread consumption problem.",
