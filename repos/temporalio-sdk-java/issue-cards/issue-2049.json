  "summary": "Feature request to support async activities in Java SDK by allowing activity methods to return CompletableFuture/CompletablePromise without blocking. The discussion explores whether activities should be able to handle Java's native async APIs and determinism constraints.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users implementing activities with Java async APIs must currently block on Future completion or use manual activity completion, reducing efficiency and usability.",
  "rootCause": "Java SDK cannot support Java's native concurrent primitives like CompletableFuture in workflows due to determinism requirements, limiting async activity patterns.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide AsyncActivityMethod annotation for activities returning CompletablePromise, with automatic handling similar to ManualActivityCompletionClient, reducing boilerplate.",
  "workaround": "Use ManualActivityCompletionClient for manual async activity completion, or use doNotCompleteOnReturn() with virtual threads.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as not planned because the existing ManualActivityCompletionClient API already provides the needed functionality for async activity patterns.",

  "keyQuote": "this case is already covered by the ManualActivityCompletionClient",
