  "summary": "The getResult() timeout on WorkflowStub is not configurable through WorkflowOptions when using the proxy API. Currently, users must use the low-level stub API to set a custom timeout, while the proxy API defaults to Integer.MAX_VALUE, preventing reasonable timeouts from being enforced.",
