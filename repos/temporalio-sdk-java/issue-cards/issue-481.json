  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users deploying workers in Kubernetes need better control over retry behavior when the server is unavailable to avoid excessive logging and implement proper deployment failure semantics.",
  "rootCause": "Workers continue retrying indefinitely at exponential backoff intervals (up to 1 minute) when server is unavailable, which doesn't integrate well with container orchestration health checks.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose backoff configuration parameters (backoffCoefficient, pollBackoffInitialInterval, pollBackoffMaximumInterval) and optionally implement a maximum retry period after which workers fail, similar to Go SDK implementation.",
  "workaround": "Implement custom health check logic to validate namespace existence before starting workers.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Health check functionality was implemented in the Java SDK based on the Go SDK pattern (client.go#L417), allowing workers to fail gracefully when the server is unavailable.",
