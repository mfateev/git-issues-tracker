  "userImpact": "Users must add non-idiomatic boilerplate code to start workers manually, causing confusion and inconsistency with standard Spring Boot patterns.",
  "rootCause": "The current implementation requires explicit `start()` calls deferred until an application event, rather than leveraging Spring Boot's standard lifecycle events.",
  "proposedFix": "Use Spring Boot's `ApplicationReadyEvent` to automatically start workers after the application is ready, eliminating the need for manual `start()` calls and test boilerplate.",
  "workaround": "Users can add `@Autowired ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationContext` and call `applicationContext.start()` in `@BeforeEach` setup methods.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented using Spring Boot's standard lifecycle events instead of requiring manual `start()` calls, making the integration idiomatic and eliminating test boilerplate.",
