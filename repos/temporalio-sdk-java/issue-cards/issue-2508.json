  "userImpact": "Users integrating the Java SDK with modern gRPC versions or applications face startup failures due to missing internal gRPC classes.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK depends on an outdated version of gRPC (specifically internal class AbstractManagedChannelImplBuilder was removed in newer versions), causing ClassNotFoundException when loaded alongside newer gRPC dependencies.",
  "proposedFix": "Update gRPC version to latest (v1.72.0 or newer) and ensure all transitive dependencies are aligned.",
  "workaround": "Users can manually override gRPC dependencies in their build configuration to use newer versions, though this shifts the burden to SDK users.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
