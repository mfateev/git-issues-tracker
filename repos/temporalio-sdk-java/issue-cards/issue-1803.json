  "userImpact": "Users may be exposed to unauthorized file access if they use the Temporal Java SDK with the vulnerable Guava version.",
  "rootCause": "FileBackedOutputStream in Google Guava versions 1.0-31.1 uses Java's default temporary directory which is world-readable on Unix systems, allowing other users/apps to access created files.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade Guava from 31.1-jre to 32.0.1-android (32.0.0 breaks Windows functionality).",
  "workaround": "Users can manually upgrade their own Guava dependency to a newer version independently of the SDK update.",

  "keyQuote": "Generally we don't update dependencies if the issue doesn't affect the SDK to avoid forcing users to upgrade...given the small diff between 31.1 and 32.0.1 it is probably fine to upgrade to silence vulnerability tools.",
