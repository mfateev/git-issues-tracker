  "summary": "When a workflow is replayed with code that calls `getVersion()` with a range that doesn't include `DEFAULT_VERSION`, the replay should fail with `UnsupportedVersion`. Currently, it incorrectly tolerates unversioned code by returning `DEFAULT_VERSION` even though it's outside the specified range.",
