  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot query running workflows by their version state in Java SDK, limiting visibility into version deployment across workflows.",
  "rootCause": "Java SDK versioning implementation differs significantly from Go SDK; versioning state machine is complex and writing search attributes creates non-deterministic workflow changes when removing old version code paths.",
  "proposedFix": "Set TemporalChangeVersion search attribute to the changeid-version when a new version is set on workflow, similar to Go SDK implementation.",
  "workaround": "Use workflow history markers to query version information, though this requires custom querying logic not provided by SDK.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Feature was implemented to set TemporalChangeVersion search attribute when workflow version is updated.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "This is a really needed feature when using workflow versioning. It works in Go SDK already.",
