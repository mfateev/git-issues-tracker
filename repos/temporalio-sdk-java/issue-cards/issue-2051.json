  "proposedFix": "Add timeout parameters to @MethodRetry annotation or create a new @ActivityTimeouts annotation to specify start-to-close and schedule-to-close timeouts at the method level with precedence over stub-level config.",

  "keyQuote": "you specify retry and timeout options on the activity stub, which is based on the interface, so in order to have specific config for each activity you have to go out of your way and break up the interface",
