  "userImpact": "Users cannot use workflow history exported from Web console or CLI for replay testing without manually converting the JSON format, blocking a key testing pattern.",
  "rootCause": "WorkflowExecutionHistory.fromJson() expects a specific internal JSON schema, but Web console and CLI export formats use different representations for timestamps (RFC3339 strings vs protobuf Duration objects) and enums (string values vs UPPER_CASE names).",
  "proposedFix": "Update WorkflowExecutionHistory.fromJson() to support multiple JSON formats (Web console, CLI, and internal SDK format) with appropriate deserializers.",
  "workaround": "Manually convert tctl JSON output by replacing enum values with matching SDK enum format and converting timestamp fields from RFC3339 strings to the expected protobuf format.",
