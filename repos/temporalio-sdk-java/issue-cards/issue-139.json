  "summary": "Users need access to the ObjectMapper created by JacksonJsonPayloadConverter to add custom Jackson modules (e.g., for Scala types, Kotlin data classes, or org-specific serialization). Currently, users must resort to reflection to modify the private mapper field.",

  "userImpact": "Scala and Kotlin users cannot easily configure Jackson to handle their language-specific types without resorting to brittle reflection hacks.",
  "rootCause": "JacksonJsonPayloadConverter does not expose the ObjectMapper, forcing users to either use reflection or create their own data converter.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide a public constructor that accepts a pre-configured ObjectMapper, or add a getObjectMapper() method to allow augmentation after creation.",
  "workaround": "Use reflection to access and modify the private 'mapper' field, though this is fragile and not recommended.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "A public constructor accepting ObjectMapper was added to JacksonJsonPayloadConverter via PR #150.",
