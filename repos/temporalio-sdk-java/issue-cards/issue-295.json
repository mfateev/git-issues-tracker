  "userImpact": "Users can now compile Temporal Java SDK applications as GraalVM native images for significantly faster startup times and reduced memory usage in containerized environments.",
  "rootCause": "GraalVM native image compilation requires reflection metadata descriptors (native-image.properties, reflect-config.json, proxy-config.json) which must be provided for the SDK and user-defined classes.",
  "proposedFix": "SDK provides native-image descriptors for Temporal classes; users supply descriptors for their own workflows using GraalVM tracing agent or manual configuration.",
  "workaround": "Use GraalVM tracing agent during testing to automatically generate native-image descriptors, then manually clean and integrate them; or manually create proxy-config.json entries for workflow interfaces.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Documentation added at docs/AOT-native-image.md with guidance on generating descriptors using the tracing agent; community-provided descriptors cleaned and integrated into the SDK.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The performance of a Java application running on a native image is super impressive.",
