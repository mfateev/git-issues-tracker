  "severity": "critical",
  "userImpact": "Applications using the Spring Boot starter are exposed to critical security vulnerabilities that could allow remote code execution through untrusted YAML deserialization.",
  "rootCause": "snakeyaml version 1.30 has unrestricted type instantiation during YAML deserialization, allowing arbitrary object instantiation by attackers.",
