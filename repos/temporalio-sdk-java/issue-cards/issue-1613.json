  "severity": "critical",
  "userImpact": "Applications using the Spring Boot starter are exposed to remote code execution and denial of service attacks through unsafe YAML deserialization.",
  "rootCause": "SnakeYaml's Constructor class does not restrict types during deserialization, allowing instantiation of arbitrary classes from untrusted YAML content.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade snakeyaml to version 2.0 for CVE-2022-1471 or version 1.31 for CVE-2022-25857, and use SafeConstructor when parsing untrusted YAML.",
  "workaround": "Use SnakeYaml's SafeConstructor class instead of Constructor when parsing untrusted YAML content.",
  "resolution": "stale",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was automatically closed by Mend as the vulnerable library was either marked as ignored or is no longer part of the Mend inventory.",

  "keyQuote": "SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization. Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution.",
