After investigation, the request was closed as the SDK cannot reliably provide the correct RunID in all scenarios.",

  "userImpact": "Users implementing custom PayloadCodecs with caching strategies cannot reliably disambiguate which workflow run a payload belongs to when executions use ContinuedAsNew or Reset.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK does not always have visibility into the new workflow execution's RunID in scenarios involving reset, continue-as-new, or child workflows, since RunIDs are generated server-side.",
  "proposedFix": "Extend HasWorkflowSerializationContext implementations to include RunID where available (all cases except ClientInterceptor), allowing it to be null when unavailable.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed by author as not a tenable solution. The fundamental issue is that the SDK cannot consistently provide the correct RunID in all execution scenarios (reset, continue-as-new, child workflows), making it unsuitable for serialization context which requires consistent information.",
