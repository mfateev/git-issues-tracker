  "userImpact": "Users must redundantly configure context propagators on each WorkflowOptions instead of setting them once at the WorkflowClient level, increasing boilerplate and configuration complexity.",
  "rootCause": "Context propagators defined in WorkflowClientOptions are not being passed through to WorkflowStubImpl, RootWorkflowClientInvoker, or RootWorkflowClientHelper during workflow creation.",
  "proposedFix": "Propagate context propagators from WorkflowClientOptions to workflow stubs created via client.newWorkflowStub() so they are automatically applied without requiring separate configuration on WorkflowOptions.",
  "workaround": "Set context propagators on individual WorkflowOptions, or use an interceptor to add them to all client stubs centrally.",
