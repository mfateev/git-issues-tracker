  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users upgrading to 1.18.1 experience workflow execution failures without clear error messages, requiring application restart and configuration changes.",
  "rootCause": "ConfigurableApplicationContext.start() must be explicitly called for workers to auto-start in version 1.18.x, a breaking change from the previous behavior.",
  "proposedFix": "Call ConfigurableApplicationContext.start() in the application to properly initialize worker auto-discovery and startup.",
  "workaround": "Manually invoke start() on the application context or implement a ContextStartedEvent listener as documented in Spring documentation.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Marked as invalid because the issue was a missing required step in the Spring Boot starter documentation - not a bug in the code but rather a behavior change that required users to adapt their initialization logic.",
