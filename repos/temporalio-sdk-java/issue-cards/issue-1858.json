  "summary": "Worker can get stuck polling only the sticky task queue when empty responses or errors occur. The sticky queue backlog should be reset on empty/error responses (like Go SDK does), but Java SDK only resets on non-empty responses, causing workers to remain stuck polling the sticky queue if all pollers are exhausted.",
