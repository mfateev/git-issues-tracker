  "summary": "Feature request to add configuration-based exclusions for interceptors to prevent certain workflows and activities from being intercepted based on their type or task queue. The maintainer suggested this is better handled programmatically through conditional logic within interceptors rather than as a configuration option.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer declined the feature, arguing that programmatic exclusion through conditionals is more flexible than configuration-based approach since configuration needs are infinite.",

  "keyQuote": "I think we should encourage programmatic exclusion when using programmatic interceptors. If someone wants to write an interceptor wrapper that does does exclusion check before applying inner interceptor, they can.",
