  "summary": "User reported that calling a synchronous workflow stub in tests doesn't propagate workflow exceptions and causes the workflow to block indefinitely. The issue was resolved by clarifying that non-TemporalFailure exceptions cause workflow task failures rather than workflow failures by design, and that ApplicationFailure should be used to properly fail workflows.",
