Activity latency metric includes both activity_type and workflow_type tags, while workflow task latency metric has workflow_type as 'none'. Documentation also needs alignment.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users receive inconsistent metric labels between activity and workflow task latency metrics, making it difficult to correlate and analyze metrics across different worker types.",
  "rootCause": "The activity schedule-to-start latency metric populates both activity_type and workflow_type tags, while the workflow task schedule-to-start latency metric only has workflow_type as 'none', creating asymmetry in metric labels.",
  "proposedFix": "Either both metrics should populate their respective type tags (activity_type for activity latency, workflow_type for workflow task latency), or neither should include the irrelevant type tag. Documentation should be updated to reflect the final decision.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Determined that workflow_type label is not relevant for pollers (task-queue level) and should be removed from documentation. The Go SDK behavior was identified as keeping the label for backwards compatibility.",

  "keyQuote": "Spoke with the team the conclusion was `workflow_type` label is only supported on the Go SDK and should be removed from the documentation since it is not relevant to pollers.",
