  "userImpact": "Users deploying Spring Boot applications with multiple activity implementations defining the same activity type would benefit from explicit failure feedback rather than silent failures.",
  "rootCause": "The WorkersTemplate currently silently skips duplicate activity registrations instead of providing an option to fail fast on detection.",

  "workaround": "Check the namespaceProperties.isIgnoreDuplicateDefinitions configuration option mentioned in the comment.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Configuration option was identified or implemented to handle duplicate definitions during worker autodiscovery.",
