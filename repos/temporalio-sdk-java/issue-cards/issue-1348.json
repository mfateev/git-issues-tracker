  "summary": "When a workflow fails due to application code throwing an exception, querying the failed workflow replays the same exception and logs it at ERROR level without context indicating it's a replay.

  "userImpact": "Users see confusing ERROR-level logs when querying failed workflows, making it difficult to distinguish actual failures from replayed exceptions in query contexts.",
  "rootCause": "The exception logging during workflow execution doesn't differentiate between original workflow failure and replay-only execution (query), resulting in ERROR logs during query replay without context about the replay.",
