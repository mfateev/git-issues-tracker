  "userImpact": "Scala developers must write verbose Java interop wrappers to use the SDK, reducing code ergonomics and adoption in Scala projects.",
  "rootCause": "The Java SDK APIs use Java-specific functional types (Func, Proc, Supplier) and collection types that don't map naturally to Scala idioms; method reference handling differs between Java and Scala.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a Scala module with idiomatic wrappers for WorkflowClient and Workflow operations, support Scala collections in serialization, and handle Scala method references correctly.",
  "workaround": "Write small wrapper functions to convert Scala functions/lambdas to Java functional types; use Scala-Java interop libraries like scala-java8-compat for Future conversion.",
