  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot create custom annotations that wrap Temporal annotations, limiting flexibility in Spring Boot integration and requiring workarounds like Byte Buddy runtime modification.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK does not recursively scan for annotations using AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation() pattern; it only reads annotations directly present on the class.",
  "proposedFix": "Modify the SDK to read annotations using Spring's AnnotationUtils.findAnnotation() or equivalent recursive annotation scanning mechanism to support meta annotations.",
  "workaround": "Use Byte Buddy to modify activity interfaces at runtime and add Temporal annotations where custom annotations are present.",
