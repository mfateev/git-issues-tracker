  "summary": "Cron workflow in Java SDK test framework executes twice as many times as expected. A workflow scheduled to run every 30 days executes 6 times in 90 days instead of the expected 3 times, with the root cause being that the workflow executes immediately on start plus additional unexpected executions.",
