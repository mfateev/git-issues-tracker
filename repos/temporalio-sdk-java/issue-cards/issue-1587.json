  "summary": "The javadoc for ActivityExecutionContext.getHeartbeatDetails is inaccurate—it states the method extracts details from the last failed attempt, but it actually returns updated details on each heartbeat call. Additionally, a new getLastHeartbeatDetails method should be added to match other SDKs and provide access to heartbeat details without automatic updates.",
