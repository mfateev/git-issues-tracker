  "userImpact": "Users must currently implement custom utility methods or use raw gRPC endpoints for common administrative tasks like checking workflow status and resetting workflows.",
  "rootCause": "Lack of structured API surface for administrative and introspection functionality outside of WorkflowClient, forcing users to create their own implementations.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a new class/interface structure to systematically expose administrative APIs with built-in pagination handling and clear documentation on Elasticsearch vs persistent store consistency.",
  "workaround": "Users implement custom utility methods wrapping raw gRPC endpoints or use tctl-equivalent operations locally.",
