  "userImpact": "Tests run extremely slowly when activities fail with long timeouts, requiring thousands of retries before timeout, making the testing experience cumbersome.",
  "rootCause": "Test framework applies realistic retry behavior based on timeout duration, so 5-day timeout with 1-second retry interval results in ~432,000 retries during time-skipping.",
  "proposedFix": "Add ability to override ActivityOptions (specifically RetryOptions#maxRetries) in test framework to limit retries, or provide built-in test mode that defaults maxRetries to a reasonable value like 1.",
  "workaround": "Manually set ActivityOptions#RetryOptions#maxRetries=1 for test scenarios, though this requires modifying workflow code or using environment variable detection.",
