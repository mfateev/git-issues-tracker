  "summary": "Implement a Remote Data Encoder framework for Java SDK to allow serving and consuming data encoding via HTTP, providing feature parity with Go and TypeScript SDKs. This enables users to encrypt data in their preferred SDK language, restrict encryption key access to a remote process, and support tctl payload encoding.",
