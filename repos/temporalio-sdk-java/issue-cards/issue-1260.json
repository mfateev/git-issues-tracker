  "userImpact": "Users may see duplicate and stale gauge metrics when workflows are rescheduled across multiple workers, potentially causing confusion about actual metric values.",
  "rootCause": "Gauges in the metrics system are host/worker-specific, not workflow-aware. When a workflow moves to a new worker, the old worker continues reporting its own gauge instance with the last recorded value.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Marked invalid because the reported behavior is the expected and correct behavior of worker gauges. Gauges are host-specific metrics, not workflow-isolated. Users should not create unique gauges per workflow.",
