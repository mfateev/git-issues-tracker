  "userImpact": "Users cannot distinguish whether an update request succeeded or if the workflow continued as new, making it unclear if the update operation was actually processed.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK has no mechanism to fail or complete an update request with a specific response when continue-as-new is called, leaving the update in an ambiguous state.",
