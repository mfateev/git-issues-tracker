  "userImpact": "Users must work with untyped ActivityStub and string-based activity names instead of compile-time safe method references, making it harder to use compared to WorkflowStub.",
  "rootCause": "ActivityInterface can have multiple ActivityMethod entries unlike WorkflowInterface which has a single entry workflow method, causing inconsistency in stub design.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a variation of ActivityStub bound to specific activity types and add ActivityStub.fromTyped method similar to WorkflowStub.fromTyped that takes a method reference instead of an instance pointer.",

  "keyQuote": "To keep things consistent, we should have a variation of the ActivityStub that binds an execution of the activity to a specific type the same way as WorkflowStub.",
