  "summary": "TestWorkflowRule enforces a 10-second global timeout by default, which creates unnecessary friction for users and duplicates JUnit's built-in timeout capabilities. The proposal is to move timeout logic to the internal SDKTestWorkflowRule, remove it from the public TestWorkflowRule, and deprecate the functionality.",
