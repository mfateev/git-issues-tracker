  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot use Spring proxies or other frameworks that add mixins to activity implementations, and cannot have multiple implementations of the same activity interface.",
  "rootCause": "Currently all interfaces implemented by a class are treated as activity interfaces when registered with an activity worker, causing issues when mixin interfaces are shared across implementations.",
  "proposedFix": "Introduce @ActivityInterface annotation to explicitly mark interfaces that define activity types, optionally with @ActivityImplementation qualifier at class level to support multiple implementations of the same interface.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The Java SDK implemented explicit annotations (@WorkflowInterface, @ActivityInterface) for marking workflow and activity definition interfaces, resolving the ambiguity and supporting multiple implementations.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "We should solve this with another common requirement to support multiple implementations of the same interface for activities.",
