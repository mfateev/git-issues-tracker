  "summary": "Workflow code that mistakenly uses Java synchronization primitives (e.g., synchronized methods) causes deadlocks since the dispatcher relies on cooperative multithreading. This feature proposes implementing a deadlock detector that fails the decision task with a clear error message when such blocking primitives are detected.",

  "userImpact": "Developers who accidentally use Java locking primitives in workflows experience mysterious deadlocks that are difficult to diagnose; clearer early detection would save significant debugging time.",
  "rootCause": "Workflow dispatcher uses cooperative multithreading, but Java synchronized primitives cause hard blocking that prevents the scheduler from making progress when multiple threads contend for the same lock.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a deadlock detection feature that monitors for Java synchronization primitives usage within workflow code and fails the decision task with a descriptive error message when detected.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Feature was implemented to detect and prevent Java synchronization primitives in workflow code.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Currently if a workflow code by mistake uses Java synchronization primitives it deadlocks as dispatcher relies on cooperative multithreading.",
