  "userImpact": "Users who don't explicitly set a catch-up window get unexpected behavior where schedules catch up every 10 seconds instead of the documented 1-year default.",
  "rootCause": "ProtobufTimeUtils was converting null/unset catch-up window to duration 0, which the server then interpreted as lower than the 10-second minimum and used the minimum instead of the documented default.",
