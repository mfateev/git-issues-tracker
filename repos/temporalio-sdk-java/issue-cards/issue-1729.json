  "userImpact": "Users attempting to return complex external objects like S3Object from activities must implement custom serialization logic instead of relying on default JSON serialization.",
  "rootCause": "S3Object contains non-serializable internal stream objects (AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject) that Jackson cannot handle by default.",
  "proposedFix": "Either fully fetch and convert S3 object to an in-memory serializable representation, or pass S3 object by reference/ID instead of as a return value.",
  "workaround": "Configure custom PayloadConverter or Jackson serialization settings to handle S3Object serialization; alternatively, fetch S3 content into memory before returning.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Temporal does not handle serialization of arbitrary objects; users are responsible for configuring their own serialization logic via PayloadConverter abstractions.",

  "keyQuote": "Generally, an object containing any kind of input stream shouldn't be used as an activity return value. The S3 object should be either fully fetched and converted into a full in-memory representation or passed by reference / id.",
