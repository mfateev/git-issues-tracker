  "summary": "Workflow metadata resolution doesn't respect generic type parameters specified in interface hierarchies. When a workflow interface extends a generic base interface like TemporalWorkflow<T>, the SDK fails to resolve the concrete type parameter and uses Object instead for query results.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot use generic type parameters in workflow interfaces, forcing data converters to treat query results as Object instead of the intended concrete type.",
  "rootCause": "Java's generic type information is erased at runtime for dynamically created instances, but preserved in class hierarchies when a concrete class extends a generic base. The SDK's metadata resolution code doesn't leverage reflection to extract preserved generic type parameters from the inheritance chain.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement reflection-based generic type parameter resolution for straightforward 1-1 unbounded cases. Reject or log warnings for complex scenarios (diamond inheritance, bounded wildcards, multiple levels of indirection) where resolution would be ambiguous.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was closed, indicating the feature was implemented to support generic type resolution in common cases.",
