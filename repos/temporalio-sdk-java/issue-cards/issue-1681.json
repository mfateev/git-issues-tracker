  "summary": "Exceptions thrown from workflow executor/control code are currently subject to failWorkflowExceptionTypes logic, which can cause internal SDK errors (like outdated cached instance detection) to fail workflow executions instead of just failing workflow tasks. The request is to exclude control code exceptions from user-configured exception type filters, with an exception for NonDeterministicException.",
