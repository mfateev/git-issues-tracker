  "userImpact": "Users find the signalWithStart method difficult to use and require checking samples to understand how to properly call it.",
  "rootCause": "The current interface design lacks conventional builders and factory methods, making it unintuitive compared to similar APIs like updateWithStart.",
  "proposedFix": "Adopt a pattern similar to the recently shipped updateWithStart API for better usability and consistency. Add untyped option for WorkflowClient.signalWithStart that takes signalName, signalData, and inputData.",
  "workaround": "Users can convert typed stubs to untyped stubs using `WorkflowStub.fromTyped()` to access the untyped signalWithStart method.",
