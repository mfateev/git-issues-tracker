  "userImpact": "Enables users to monitor thread pool usage and tune worker performance more effectively through deterministic metric tags that persist across deployments.",
  "rootCause": "Current identity scheme uses process-unique values, preventing metric correlation across worker instances and deployments.",
  "proposedFix": "Add an optional 'identityGroup' property to WorkflowClientOptions to provide a static, non-unique identifier for grouping workers across processes for metric correlation.",
  "workaround": "Users could set a static identity value, but this would lose the ability to identify individual pollers uniquely.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Rob was able to solve the problem using existing APIs and capabilities that Temporal provides.",

  "keyQuote": "what I'm describing is impossible if there is more than 1 poller in the process. Defining a static identity value would provide us this capability, but then we would lose the ability to identify pollers uniquely",
