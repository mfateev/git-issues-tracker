  "summary": "Proposal to support pluggable workflow caches in the Java SDK to allow customizable eviction strategies beyond the current synchronous LRU algorithm. This addresses scenarios where high-volume workloads with abandoned workflows could benefit from alternatives like TTL-based or asynchronous eviction mechanisms.",

  "userImpact": "Users with high-volume workloads can implement custom cache eviction strategies optimized for their specific workload patterns instead of being limited to the default LRU algorithm.",
  "rootCause": "Current integrated LRU cache may not be optimal for all workloads, particularly when workflows are abandoned by remote workers without invalidation signals, creating unnecessary eviction overhead.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a pluggable cache mechanism that defaults to the current LRU design while allowing SDK users to supply custom implementations, potentially including TTL-based or asynchronous eviction strategies.",
