  "userImpact": "Users cannot register multiple Activity implementations that share inherited non-annotated methods without encountering registration errors.",
  "rootCause": "The activity registration logic treats all inherited methods as activity types, causing name conflicts when multiple implementations inherit the same non-@ActivityMethod from a parent interface.",
  "proposedFix": "Use namePrefix in @ActivityInterface to make each activity type name unique and avoid conflicts from inherited methods.",
  "workaround": "Apply namePrefix parameter in @ActivityInterface annotations on each Activity interface to ensure unique activity type names.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers clarified this is expected behavior - duplicate activity methods cannot be registered. Users should use namePrefix as a solution.",

  "keyQuote": "This is expected behaviour, duplicate activity methods cannot be registered. You can consider using namePrefix in ActivityInterface so each method has a unique activity type",
