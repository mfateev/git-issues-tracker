  "summary": "The WorkflowServiceStubsOptions#rpcLongPollTimeout is currently hardcoded to require a minimum of 70 seconds due to the server's 60-second timeout. This prevents users with strict network configurations (like reverse proxies) from using shorter polling timeouts. The request is to make this timeout configurable to support shorter values.",

  "userImpact": "Users with strict network layer configurations (reverse proxies, middleware) cannot configure shorter long poll timeouts, forcing them to use the 70-second minimum.",
  "rootCause": "The server's 60-second timeout cap and safety margin implementation require the client to always use 70+ seconds, but this doesn't account for users with stricter network constraints.",
  "proposedFix": "Allow the SDK to accept rpcLongPollTimeout values less than 70 seconds, and let the server handle returning responses based on the request's context timeout/deadline.",
