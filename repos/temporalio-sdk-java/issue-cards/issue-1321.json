  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily determine if they are executing within a workflow context without risking exceptions, limiting safe conditional logic in shared code.",
  "rootCause": "Workflow.getInfo() throws an exception rather than providing a safe way to detect workflow context, forcing users to either rely on unsafe APIs or catch exceptions.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose io.temporal.workflow.unsafe.WorkflowUnsafe.isWorkflowThread() as a public API or create a new Workflow.isWorkflowThread() method.",
  "workaround": "Use the existing internal io.temporal.workflow.unsafe.WorkflowUnsafe.isWorkflowThread() API despite it being marked unsafe.",
  "resolution": "duplicate",
  "resolutionDetails": "The requested functionality already exists as WorkflowUnsafe.isWorkflowThread(); issue was closed as the API is available, though marked as internal/unsafe.",
