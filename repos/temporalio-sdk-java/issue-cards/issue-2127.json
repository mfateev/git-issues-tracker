  "summary": "Test server occasionally fails to include signal events in the first workflow task for SDK Python when signals are sent before the worker starts, particularly on macOS Intel runners. The signal event is sometimes missing from the first WFT activation, causing the workflow to process start_workflow before signal_workflow.",
