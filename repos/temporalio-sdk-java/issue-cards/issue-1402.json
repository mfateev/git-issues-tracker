  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users running microservices with different payload encoding schemes cannot easily configure the SDK to encode with one scheme while decoding multiple schemes without workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "PayloadCodec interface combines encoding and decoding into a single unified interface, preventing independent configuration of multiple encoders and decoders.",
  "proposedFix": "Split PayloadCodec into separate PayloadEncoder and PayloadDecoder interfaces with independent lists, allowing flexible configuration of encoding and decoding strategies through configuration like `temporal.payload-encoding=binary/encrypt,binary/gzip`.",
  "workaround": "Use a custom CodecDataConverter or external library to implement complex conditional logic outside of the Temporal Java SDK.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers declined to make breaking changes to PayloadCodec interface, suggesting complex logic can be implemented in custom PayloadCodec or CodecDataConverter instead.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "We have no plan to make breaking changes to the `PayloadCodec` interface. In general if you want complex conditional logic that can be done in the `PayloadCodec` or a custom `CodecDataConverter`",
