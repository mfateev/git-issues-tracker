The maxConcurrentWorkflowTaskExecutionSize setting can be set lower than the minimum required executors (2: one for sticky queue, one for main queue), causing worker initialization failures.",

  "proposedFix": "Add validation in WorkerOptions to enforce minimum executor count constraints and reject configurations that would prevent dual-queue polling.",
