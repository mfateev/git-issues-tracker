  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Applications using the Java SDK alongside other gRPC libraries with newer versions cannot initialize the Temporal client due to missing internal gRPC classes.",
  "rootCause": "AbstractManagedChannelImplBuilder was removed from gRPC internal APIs between versions, but the Java SDK was built against older gRPC version and may have dependencies that conflict with newer versions.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade gRPC dependency to current version (1.73.0 or later) and ensure compatibility with internal API changes.",
  "workaround": "Downgrade other gRPC dependencies to 1.58.1 to match the Java SDK's gRPC version, though this is not recommended as 1.58.1 is from 2023.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was determined to be user-side dependency version conflict rather than SDK bug; SDK is tested and confirmed compatible with gRPC 1.72.0+. Root cause was likely mixed gRPC versions in user's classpath.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The Java SDK builds against an older version of grpc since we are a library but you are encouraged to use a more recent version in your application.",
