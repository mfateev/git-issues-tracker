UI is not the only place payload bytes may be viewed. Is this solving an efficiency problem that is really a problem or is it predicting one? And by \"efficiency\" are you referring to storage size only or serialization speed as well? If storage size is the only concern, there are other potential options too.","createdAt":"2022-01-03T15:01:49Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/435#issuecomment-1004150676","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1848Ex5H","author":{"login":"lorensr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"This is a suggestion from @bergundy. I know of no users with such an issue. I imagine it's not about a *problem* and more an impulse toward reducing resources used/load in the system—I think mainly lower storage space, but there might also be small improvements in network transfer time and serialization speed. \r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the other places users view payloads, but if it's a common occurrence, I like JSON. My personal preference is usually DX over efficiency.","createdAt":"2022-01-08T04:53:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/435#issuecomment-1007885895","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-12-25T02:40:02Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":435,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Make binary the default protobuf data converter","updatedAt":"2023-01-10T17:50:52Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/435"}
