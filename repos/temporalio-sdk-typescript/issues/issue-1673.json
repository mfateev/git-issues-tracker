Please describe.\n\nHello,\nfor some reason need to create the report (CSV) from the ALL workflow execution results, how it looks now:\n```ts\nasync function* fetchWorkflowExecutionResults({ workflowClient, namespace, companyId }) {\n  let nextPageToken: Uint8Array | undefined;\n  do {\n        const workflows = await workflowClient.workflowService.listWorkflowExecutions({\n            namespace,\n            query: `ExecutionStatus=\"Completed\" AND WorkflowType=\"createCompanyWorkflow\" AND companyId=\"${companyId}`,\n            nextPageToken,\n        });\n        nextPageToken = workflows.nextPageToken;\n\n        for (const wf of workflows.executions) {\n          const result = await workflowClient\n                    .getHandle(wf.execution.workflowId, wf.execution.runId)\n                    .result();\n          yield {\n            company_id: result.company_id,\n            field1: result.field1,\n            field2: result.field2,\n            another_field: result.another_field,\n          };\n        }\n  } while (nextPageToken?.byteLength);\n}\n```\nit's working as expected for any amount of the executions, but it takes around ~1min to process 1000 executions, so for 1KK executions -> ~1000 minutes, which is not acceptable for my purposes.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nFor faster processing, I can chunk workflows.executions (e.g., in batches of 50 or 100) using Promise.all(). However, I'm not sure if this is the correct behavior — it might make more sense to add a separate method for this.\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-04-10T06:52:30Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1673,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Add support for batched result retrieval executions","updatedAt":"2025-04-10T06:52:30Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1673"}
