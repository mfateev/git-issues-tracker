However, the TS SDK does not currently include that `runId` in the thrown `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError`. It should be.\n\n### Misc\n\nThe `runId` is stored as part of the protobuf-encoded error details, which the TS SDK already knows how to decode. Extracting this extra detail should therefore be reasonably easy.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-11-21T23:12:54Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1838,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Bug] `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError` should contain `runId` if provided by server","updatedAt":"2025-11-21T23:12:54Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1838"}
