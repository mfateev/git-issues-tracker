Could be a Map where key is activityType and value current \"in flight\" number of this activity type.\n\nThis feature would be really useful for different types of debugging for example, when user detects that \nall worker activity task slots are full, basically worker stops at that point polling for more activity tasks, they can check what activity types are occupying worker and not releasing task slot.\n\nIts ok I think if this was maybe behind a flag like env var to turn it on. Should probably not be a worker config which would require a worker restart :) \n\nBelieve ActivityType should be exposed in activityOperator.
