This makes TypeScript throw errors when using the SDK in a project that has decided to not use these legacy support flags any more.\r\n\r\nWe were able to work around this with very small patches to your code, e.g. use `import * as webpack from 'webpack';` instead of `import webpack from 'webpack';`, so I believe it would be easy and helpful if you would disable these flags in the SDK as well.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185Rliho","author":{"login":"neelance"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Seems like this got resolved.
