Please describe.\n\nMy team has Workflows and Activities developed on different release cycles. We use Worker Versioning to either pin or use latest version of a Workflow. However, when a Workflow calls an Activity, even if the Activity Worker uses Worker Versioning, there is no way for the Workflow to specify the version of the Activity to use. We have resorted to baking the Activity version into the task queue name, which is not ideal as our Workers are already using Deployments and Versioning.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd `versioningOverride` to `ActivityOptions`, and have the Temporal Service use the `versioningOverride` (as well as the worker defaults specified in `WorkerDeploymentOptions`) to resolve the scheduled Activity to a Worker Deployment.\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis would mostly leverage the work already done for [Workflow Versioning](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1659).\n","closedAt":"2025-07-29T18:57:19Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-29T18:51:21Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1752,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add Activity support for Worker Versioning","updatedAt":"2025-07-29T18:57:19Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1752"}
