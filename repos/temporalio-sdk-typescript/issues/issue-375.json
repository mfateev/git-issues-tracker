For more information and possible causes, see: \r\n\r\n[docs URL]\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that in the future we can easily update the wiki page, and users of old versions of the SDK will see the updated page.\r\n\r\nThe docs page could say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe Worker process that picked up this task doesn't have a Workflow function named 'foo' in its bundle. \r\nThe issue might be:\r\n\r\n- There's a typo in the Workflow function name.\r\n- The Workflow function isn't exported.\r\n- The entry point (`workflowsPath`) is incorrect.\r\n- You have more Worker processes than you realize polling on the 'tutorial' queue. For instance, a process in another shell or in the background that has an old version of the Workflow code bundle or that's from a different Temporal project. You can check with `ps` or `tctl tq desc --tq tutorial`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMigrated from #359\r\n","closedAt":"2023-01-23T23:46:08Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185AfrPu","author":{"login":"lorensr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Can also list the functions that are exported","createdAt":"2022-03-29T15:46:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/375#issuecomment-1082045422","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185GoNfI","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Let's just list the functions that are exported","createdAt":"2022-07-14T22:12:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/375#issuecomment-1184946120","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-11-10T23:04:29Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":375,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Improve error message: 'foo' is not a function","updatedAt":"2023-01-23T23:46:08Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/375"}
