Metrics exporter otlp failed with the grpc server returns error (Internal error): , detailed error message: Missing response message.`). Those tests are using a bare HTTP2 server to grossly emulate a OTLP collector grpc-service. Due to a recent update to Core (maybe to one of its underlying dependencies), the OTLP emitter now reports failure to get a proper grpc response form the collector service.\r\n\r\n- These error messages have coincided with one case where our integration tests completely hanged in CI (I stopped them after 3.5 hours), though I don't know at this point either there is an actual connection between the these two symptoms.\r\n\r\n- Until we can rewrite those tests to use a more convincing mock collector, I have disabled those tests.","closedAt":"2025-05-05T21:18:41Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-08-14T15:27:59Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1495,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Reenable OTLP export tests","updatedAt":"2025-05-05T21:18:41Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1495"}
