However this path is not being read\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nCreate a Profile TOML file on a Mac using the CLI, which writes a file to: $HOME/Library/Application Support/temporal/temporal.toml\nCreate a Typescript program that attempts to read the Profile using the Env Config APIs. An error will be thrown that the profile cannot be found\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\n- OS and processor: macOS\n- Temporal Typescript SDK Version: 1.14.0\n","closedAt":"2026-01-06T16:46:59Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx187dLz7o","author":{"login":"THardy98"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Hi @pvsone \n\nThis is a typo in the docs, the path should be `temporalio/temporal.toml` not `temporal/temporal.toml`","createdAt":"2026-01-05T15:19:08Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1869#issuecomment-3710861032","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx187dMIKM","author":{"login":"pvsone"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Good catch.
