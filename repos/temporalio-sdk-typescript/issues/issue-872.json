(While untrusted schemas are recommended against, the worst case of an untrusted schema should be a denial of service, not execution of code.)\n\n<p>Publish Date: 2020-07-15\n<p>URL: <a href=https://www.mend.io/vulnerability-database/CVE-2020-15366>CVE-2020-15366</a></p>\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n###  CVSS 3 Score Details (<b>5.6</b>)\n<p>\n\nBase Score Metrics:\n- Exploitability Metrics:\n  - Attack Vector: Network\n  - Attack Complexity: High\n  - Privileges Required: None\n  - User Interaction: None\n  - Scope: Unchanged\n- Impact Metrics:\n  - Confidentiality Impact: Low\n  - Integrity Impact: Low\n  - Availability Impact: Low\n</p>\nFor more information on CVSS3 Scores, click <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0\">here</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n###  Suggested Fix\n<p>\n\n<p>Type: Upgrade version</p>\n<p>Release Date: 2020-07-15</p>\n<p>Fix Resolution: ajv - 6.12.3</p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n</details>","closedAt":"2022-12-16T22:39:27Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185LM-kH","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":heavy_check_mark: This issue was automatically closed by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) was either marked as ignored or it is no longer part of the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2022-09-29T03:13:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/872#issuecomment-1261693191","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185LvIUr","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":information_source: This issue was automatically re-opened by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) has been detected in the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2022-10-06T20:34:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/872#issuecomment-1270646059","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185MfiHr","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":heavy_check_mark: This issue was automatically closed by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) was either marked as ignored or it is no longer part of the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2022-10-19T02:51:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/872#issuecomment-1283334635","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185NOkD0","author":{"login":"mend-for-github-com"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":":information_source: This issue was automatically re-opened by Mend because the vulnerable library in the specific branch(es) has been detected in the Mend inventory.","createdAt":"2022-10-29T00:36:36Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/872#issuecomment-1295663348","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-09-17T22:20:00Z","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOEujx187tOfPy","name":"Mend: dependency security vulnerability","description":"Security vulnerability detected by WhiteSource","color":"d1260f"}],"milestone":null,"number":872,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"istanbul-instrumenter-loader-3.0.1.tgz: 1 vulnerabilities (highest severity is: 5.6)","updatedAt":"2022-12-16T22:39:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/872"}
