Please describe.\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\n\nWhen we run tests, we create a new Temporal Namespace for each test, and have that test's Worker connect to that namespace. This ensures tests can be run in parallel while being isolated from each other.\n\nIt also means we have a Worker per test. There are some things related to logs that we would like to be able to test, for example:\n- Assert on log output\n- Suppress Activity failure logs when they are expected\n\nHowever, because the logger is configured by `Runtime.install`, which is global, it is not possible to have multiple Workers running in the same process using different logger instances so we can have per-test behaviour.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\nAllow the Logger to be configured at the Worker level. This would allow us to create a \"test logger\" instance for each test to enable what we want.\n\n### Additional context\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-12-30T10:57:00Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1867,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Per-Worker Logger","updatedAt":"2025-12-30T10:58:21Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1867"}
