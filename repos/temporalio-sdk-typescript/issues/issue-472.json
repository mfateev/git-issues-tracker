A temporal eslint plugin would need some way to determine what is workflow code and what isn't. The example eslint config does it by explicitly naming workflow files, but that strategy might be more difficult to apply to user projects.","createdAt":"2022-08-15T14:39:34Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/472#issuecomment-1215089701","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185Vjien","author":{"login":"tommyk"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"catching `throw Error('...');` in workflows would be an awesome add as well.  i was about to start writing a custom rule for that and figured i would check the issues if this was created already and found this.   \r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2023-02-17T23:06:30Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/472#issuecomment-1435379623","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-02-09T16:40:07Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":472,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] eslint plugin","updatedAt":"2023-02-17T23:06:30Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/472"}
