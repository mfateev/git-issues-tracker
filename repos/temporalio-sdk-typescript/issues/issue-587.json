If it was a property on an object, the name change would be obvious, but since it's an unnamed parameter it can be hard to know. FWIW, \"non-retryable\" is common Temporal nomenclature, so while the double negative may be personally annoying, it does fit with the rest of the Temporal ecosystem.","createdAt":"2022-04-14T13:47:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/587#issuecomment-1099205277","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-04-14T03:23:30Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":6,"title":"1.0","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":587,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Change nonRetryable constructor param","updatedAt":"2022-04-18T20:21:01Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/587"}
