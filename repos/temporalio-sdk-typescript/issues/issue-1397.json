Please describe.\r\nFollowing [this](https://community.temporal.io/t/wait-for-signal-best-practices/1737), we are trying to implement a wait for multiple signals in a Temporal Workflow. It seems that the JVM SDK has `Workflow.await` suited exactly for this purpose, is there a similar tool in Typescript?\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nExpressing our workflow e.g. like this:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nWorkflow.wait(() -> allSignalsReceived());\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nSo far we have managed to implement this as a `while` loop:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nwhile(true) {\r\n  if(allSignalsReceived()) {\r\n    break;\r\n  }\r\n  await workflow.sleep(1000);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above implementation is causing `OutOfMemory` issues for the workers, we understand this is because every iteration of the unbounded loop is getting cached. We understand we might be able to resolve the memory issues with `workflow.continueAsNew` or by drastically reducing the `maxCachedWorkflows` param, but neither of these options seem like a production-grade solution.\r\n","closedAt":"2024-04-22T12:02:13Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1857VcV-","author":{"login":"jacek-rzrz"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Closing - turns out there is `workflow.condition` for this exact purpose already!","createdAt":"2024-04-22T12:02:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1397#issuecomment-2069218686","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-04-22T11:18:16Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1397,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Await multiple signals in a workflow","updatedAt":"2024-04-22T12:02:13Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1397"}
