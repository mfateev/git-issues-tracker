Please describe.\n\nOpen Telemetry got new major version - v2 and some libs `0.200.0`\nPlease update your lib to support new Otel library version\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx187WdyVB","author":{"login":"mjameswh"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is coming up soon.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't simply \"upgrade\" to OTel v2, as that would be a breaking change for all existing Temporal setups. The plan is therefore to make a _new_ package for this, something like `@temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry2` (haven't made a final decision on the package name), so that both plugin versions can coexist.\n\nNow, we're going through some heavy work to improve the completeness and DX on the OTel v1 interceptor at the moment. Those improvements will also be applicable to the v2, so much that it makes little sense to create the OTel v2 before we're done with present work on v1.\n\nSo the path forward will be, in proper order:\n\n1. Complete current efforts on [covering _all_ events](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/pull/1835) through the OTel v1 interceptors\n2. Complete effort on extending the OTel interceptors v1 to the new Plugin form.\n3. Address serialization issues with the workflow/sink layer that are causing errors in some setups (#1779 and #1738).\n4. Duplicate the OTel v1 package to a new OTel v2 package, and adapt the code as needed.\n\nIn the mean time, you may use your own v2 copy of the OTel interceptors. There's really nothing here that requires that to be part of the official SDK.","createdAt":"2025-12-01T18:13:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1658#issuecomment-3598132545","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-03-24T08:17:17Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1658,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":19}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Add support for opentelemetry v2","updatedAt":"2025-12-01T18:13:12Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1658"}
