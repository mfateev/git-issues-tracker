I imagine at least in the `nonRetryable: false` case, and perhaps `TemporalFailure` and others, it should just be a `WorkflowTaskFailed` event. It's a `WorkflowTaskFailed` event when a plain object or `Error` instance is thrown.","closedAt":"2022-02-02T18:15:25Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1849SWXV","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Throwing a TemporalFailure from workflow code should fail the workflow.\r\nThis is by design.","createdAt":"2022-02-02T18:15:25Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/459#issuecomment-1028220373","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1849SXe8","author":{"login":"lorensr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Oh, retry policy is for `WorkflowExecutionFailed`s, not for `WorkflowTaskFailed`, got it.
