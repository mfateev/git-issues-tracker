That is, the activity will intentionally fail with a retryable failure if the poll operation returned nothing new. At present, the SDK's activity worker logs each of these intentional activity failures at WARN level, which creates undesirable noise.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a specific API for activities to \"intentionally fail so that the activity task is retried\", which would not cause extra logging. This could take the form of a special type of exception, similar to `CompleteAsyncError`, a special return value that could be returned from the activity function, or some function attached to the activity context that would internally throw the exception (similar to how `continueAsNew()` currently works).","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-15T19:26:25Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1420,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Clean API to intentionally fail an activity in long-polling patterns","updatedAt":"2024-05-15T19:26:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1420"}
