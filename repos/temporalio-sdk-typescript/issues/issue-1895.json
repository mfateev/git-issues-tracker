API to create a distinct deterministic PRNG instance\n2. Possibility of generating UUIDs from that distinct PRNG instances (i.e. rather than only from the workflow’s global PRNG).\n3. Possibility of activating a given PRNG instance as the “global” one within a given execution scope. This is required to ensure that third-party, non-Temporal libraries used by Temporal plugins don’t disrupt the workflow’s actual PRNG sequence.","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2026-01-15T23:29:22Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1895,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Add workflow API to create independent deterministic pseudo-number sequence","updatedAt":"2026-01-15T23:29:22Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1895"}
