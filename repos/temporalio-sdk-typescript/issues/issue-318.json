Please describe.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the node-sdk docs seem to encourage letting temporal generate the workflow id, but there are lots of cases where that leads to trouble. The Concepts docs recommends providing a business-meaningful workflow id, which I think is better advice.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.temporal.io/docs/node/client/#workflow-handle-options\r\n\r\n> Most users should do just fine with the autogenerated workflowId.\r\n\r\nThe problem with that statement is that while it is statistically true, there are a class of use cases where it is not suitable (e.g., the cases where signalWithStart is useful).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n@sw-yx I suggest hinting that there is more to workflow id than meets the eye, and linking to the full description:\r\n[Workflows | Temporal documentation](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/concepts/workflows#workflow-id)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI also think the node-sdk docs blur the distinction between createHandle and creating a new workflow - which is once again an important one when dealing with signalWithStart.\r\n","closedAt":"2021-11-23T04:06:26Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1846LiCP","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@joebowbeer Is this addressed now in your opinion?\r\n`workflowId` is now required in all `WorkflowClient` methods.","createdAt":"2021-11-23T02:07:10Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/318#issuecomment-976101519","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1846Luln","author":{"login":"joebowbeer"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Addressed.","createdAt":"2021-11-23T04:06:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/318#issuecomment-976152935","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-10-20T17:35:46Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":318,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Improve workflow id documentation","updatedAt":"2021-11-23T04:06:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/318"}
