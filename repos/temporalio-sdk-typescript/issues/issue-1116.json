The created hello-world project is configured to use TypeScript `^4.4.2` but this is incompatible with the supplied version of `tsconfig/node20` due to its usage of `es2023` in the `lib` configuration. I believe this requires TypeScript >= 5.\r\n\r\n### Minimal Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate the hello-world application with `npx @temporalio/create@latest ./my-app` and then attempt to run using `npm run start.watch`\r\n\r\n### Environment/Versions\r\n\r\n- OS and processor: M1 Mac\r\n- Temporal Version: temporal version 0.8.0 (server 1.20.1) (ui 2.13.3)\r\n- Are you using Docker or Kubernetes or building Temporal from source? Temporal installed via Homebrew\r\n\r\n- Node: v20.0.0\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n","closedAt":"2023-05-26T17:37:19Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185b9-_T","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Thanks for reporting, we're still working on officially supporting node 20.\r\nCC @mjameswh ","createdAt":"2023-05-11T00:35:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"HEART","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1116#issuecomment-1542975443","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185dQ6JY","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing in favor of https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1125","createdAt":"2023-05-26T17:37:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1116#issuecomment-1564713560","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-05-11T00:34:02Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1116,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] @temporalio/create produces unbuildable hello-world project","updatedAt":"2023-05-26T17:37:20Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1116"}
