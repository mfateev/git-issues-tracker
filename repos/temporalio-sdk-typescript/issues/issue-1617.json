Please describe.\n\nI want to be able to differentiate between activities in the temporal UI.\n\nCurrently, each activity takes the name of the function i.e. `someActivity` but I am regularly looping functions but with different parameters.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like the ability to name the activity, so that it's easy to differentiate from the same function being executed with different params. Potentially by passing a `activityName` parameter or similar to show in the UI.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI know you can see the parameters by clicking on the activity, but I would like to see the name of the activity at a glance in the timeline (without having to click on each one individually)","closedAt":"2025-01-30T19:24:14Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx186cfCO-","author":{"login":"mjameswh"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Sure!
