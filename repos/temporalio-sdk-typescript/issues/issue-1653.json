Some examples use code that has doctoring with broken links. I have been unable to find the documentation anywhere on the docs site. Guidance is appreciated.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThe following link is in the docstrings: https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/production-deploy#pre-build-code\n\nand it does not resolve. I cannot find any supplemental documentation, but this seems quite important from the code.\n\nThis is the code: https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/packages/worker/src/worker-options.ts#L158 \n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\nInteraface `WorkerOptions`, field `workflowBundle`,\n\n```ts\n  /**\n     * Use a pre-built bundle for Workflow code. Use {@link bundleWorkflowCode} to generate the bundle. The version of\n     * `@temporalio/worker` used when calling `bundleWorkflowCode` must be the exact same version used when calling\n     * `Worker.create`.\n     *\n     * This is the recommended way to deploy Workers to production.\n     *\n     * See https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/production-deploy#pre-build-code for more information.\n     *\n     * When using this option, {@link workflowsPath}, {@link bundlerOptions} and any Workflow interceptors modules\n     * provided in * {@link interceptors} are not used. To use workflow interceptors, pass them via\n     * {@link BundleOptions.workflowInterceptorModules} when calling {@link bundleWorkflowCode}.\n     */\n    workflowBundle?: WorkflowBundleOption;\n```\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-03-17T21:01:52Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1653,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Bug] Broken Documentation Link","updatedAt":"2025-03-17T21:01:52Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1653"}
