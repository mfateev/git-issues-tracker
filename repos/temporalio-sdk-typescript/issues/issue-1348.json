Please describe.\nSupport for Eager Workflow Start (EWS) was added in the server in 1.20, and is currently supported in Java, Python, Core, and Go SDKs.

See [https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/242](https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/242) for details.\n\nThe goal is to enable support for EWS in the TS SDK.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nThis is dependent on [https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/3776](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/3776)\n\n","closedAt":"2025-09-03T00:21:45Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-01-29T19:13:58Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1348,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":3}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Eager Workflow Start","updatedAt":"2025-09-03T00:21:45Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1348"}
