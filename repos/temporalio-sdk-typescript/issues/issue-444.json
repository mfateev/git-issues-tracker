We can provide clarity by logging a warning in development. It would be nice if the Client logged, but I don't think there's currently a [way for it to know](temporalio/sdk-features#51), so the Worker can log:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Workflow \"my-workflow-id\" received signal \"fooSignal\" but does not have a handler registered for \"fooSignal\". This may be due to:\r\n- \"fooSignal\" is misspelled, either on the Client or in the Workflow.\r\n- You haven't yet called `setHandler` for \"fooSignal\" in the Workflow.\r\n- This Worker is running with an outdated version of your Workflow code that doesn't call `setHandler`. Try restarting this Worker process.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n\r\nSlack discussion: https://temporaltechnologies.slack.com/archives/C01FT8U10GK/p1640455191114100\r\n\r\nNote that this isn't an issue for queries. `await handle.query(unregisterdQuery)` throws with: `Workflow did not register a handler for unregisterdQuery`","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2022-01-10T02:27:41Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":444,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Warn user when sending unregistered signal","updatedAt":"2024-12-17T21:30:42Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/444"}
