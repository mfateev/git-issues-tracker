It works in a real Temporal instance because the `activityInfo().workflowExecution.runId` is a UUID, however the `MockActivityEnvironment` does not generate UUIDs.\n\nI need to know whether the Workflow run ID is always a UUID, and I can depend on that. If so, the `MockActivityEnvironment` should be updated to match that behaviour.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\n\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots or code blocks to help explain your problem. You can also use [Loom](http://loom.com/) to do short, free video bug reports. -->\n\n### Minimal Reproduction\n\n<!-- \nModify our hello world templates to demonstrate:\n\n- TypeScript: https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world\n- Go: https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-go\n- Java: https://github.com/temporalio/money-transfer-project-template-java\n- PHP: https://github.com/temporalio/samples-php#samples\n-->\n\n```typescript\nimport { activityInfo } from \"@temporalio/activity\"\nimport * as uuid from \"uuid\"\n\nexport async myActivity(): Promise<string> {\n  const info = activityInfo()\n  return uuid.v5(info.activityId, info.workflowExecution.runId)\n}\n```\n\nRun this activity in a real instance and it works. Run it with `WorkflowTestEnvironment` and it fails with `TypeError: Invalid UUID`.\n\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\n<!-- Please complete the following information where relevant. -->\n\n`@temporalio/testing`: `1.11.7`\n\n","closedAt":"2025-08-19T23:28:25Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-07T11:02:50Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1706,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] MockActivityEnvironment's activityInfo().workflowExecution.runId is not a UUID","updatedAt":"2025-08-19T23:28:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1706"}
