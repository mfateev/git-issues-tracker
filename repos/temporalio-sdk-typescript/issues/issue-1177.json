This will allow various customizations to metrics handling, including:\n\n* Exporting additional/custom metrics;\n* Filtering out some metrics (to reduce cost, since commercial metrics collectors generally charge per metric);\n* Export to metrics collectors that are not supported by Core itself.\n\nThis ticket is tracking effort at adding support in TS SDK for accepting and handling metrics from Core SDK. The scope of this ticket does not extend to the development of a metric exporter for any specific metrics collector.\n\nAlso see the corresponding .Net feature request [here](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/issues/126).\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185h6Ekj","author":{"login":"cretz"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Until this is also in at least one other core language, I would like to see it marked experimental.
