That would technically allow much greater customizations, but would probably make maintenance of these message files a little bit more complicated.","createdAt":"2023-05-29T17:01:48Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/541#issuecomment-1567350796","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185dbAbe","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I think our package initializer is complex enough as is.\r\nThe custom template is more than enough imho.\r\nLet’s close this.","createdAt":"2023-05-29T17:13:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/541#issuecomment-1567360734","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-03-16T00:06:29Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":541,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] After `create`, give customized setup instructions","updatedAt":"2023-05-29T17:13:01Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/541"}
