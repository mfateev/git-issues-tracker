Please describe.\r\n\r\nWhen for example using the `sleep` method, it's possible to describe the time as a string, because of the built-in `ms` package. It would be great to use the string types from `ms` instead of a simple `string` type, to have typechecking on the given time argument.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nThe solution would be to use the typing provided by `ms`: https://github.com/vercel/ms/blob/78ce59eab01c197b9133bf9752ae01fbc11f4976/src/index.ts#L44\r\n\r\n","closedAt":"2023-06-14T21:32:42Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185Wd_y8","author":{"login":"mjameswh"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@bergundy This is what I have in mind for this.\r\n\r\nIt maintains backward compatibility, at the cost of complaining about deprecation rather than entirely refusing incorrect syntaxes.
