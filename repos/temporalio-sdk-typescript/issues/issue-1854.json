It states that `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` will override the value provided. This appears to be incorrect given that there is no code that references the environment variable. Additionally, if such code existed, it would break metrics export since `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` for HTTP is typically `http://localhost:4318` but this package expects a URL with the path (e.g., `http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics`).\n\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/6b89dfc95ebb8554e439a0f2b2c26d5783bfa1d7/packages/worker/src/runtime-options.ts#L225-L236\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
