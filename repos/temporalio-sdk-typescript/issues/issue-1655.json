I have included some details of my rationale below.\n\nNonetheless, we understand that the mere presence of such a dependency might trigger alerts by audit engines and therefore pose challenges to various compliance requirements. An update will therefore be included in the next patch release.\n\n**Details**\n\n- The Temporal SDK only uses the `zip` library to extract downloaded ephemeral server binaries (i.e. when using the `TestWorkflowEnvironment.createXxx()`, with `server.executable.type = 'cached-download'`). This API is only meant to be used in test environment.\n- The Ephemeral Server archive file is always downloaded from a trusted source (i.e. an HTTP service under our control, using TLS). We only use ZIP archives for Windows binaries.\n- The ZIP archive already contains an executable file.\n\nGiven the above facts, it appears that:\n\n1. An attacker would need to exploit a much more significant vulnerability (e.g. at the DNS and/or TLS layer; by hacking our hosting service; etc) in order to compromise the downloaded ZIP archive.\n2. An attacker that would be able to compromise the downloaded ZIP archive would anyway be able to simply replace the server's binary contained in that archive, without any further advantage resulting from CVE-2025-29787.","createdAt":"2025-03-24T21:02:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1655#issuecomment-2749388400","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx186r_lzr","author":{"login":"mjameswh"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This was fixed in 1.11.8.","createdAt":"2025-05-16T04:03:06Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1655#issuecomment-2885573867","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-03-18T08:54:50Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":1655,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Dependency Vulnerability: Zip library","updatedAt":"2025-05-16T04:03:07Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1655"}
