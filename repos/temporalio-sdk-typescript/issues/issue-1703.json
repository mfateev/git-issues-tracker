In particular, the following items still have to be implemented to provide a complete and reliable DX.\n\n- [ ] Add support `OperatorService` and `HealthService`.\n- [ ] Add bridge side support for accepting an inbound `AbortSignal`.\n- [ ] Add support for missing Core's `Client` options that were meaningless for Worker-only use cases (e.g. `identity` and `retry_config`, anything else?). Double check with what we expose on `Connection` and what is exposed by other SDKs on their own `Client`.\n- [ ] Ensure that any existing `Client` test covers both `Connection` and `NativeConnection` use cases.\n\nUsing `Client` over `NativeConnection` will be required to support Eager Workflow Start, which means that this usage may become dominant in some environments.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-01T19:56:26Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1703,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Complete work on supporting `Client` over `NativeConnection`","updatedAt":"2025-07-01T21:10:55Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1703"}
