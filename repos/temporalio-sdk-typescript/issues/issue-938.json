Please describe.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, it is very difficult to identify changes to exported members signatures from our SDK packages. This leads to two negative consequences:\r\n\r\n- Risk of unexpected breaking changes in patch or minor releases;\r\n- Risk of exposing members that were never meant for public usage (thus increasing even more the risk of further breaking changes).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nUse a tool run in CICD that:\r\n1. Identify the exact set of publicly exported APIs\r\n2. Reports changes in these exported APIs relative to the appropriate baseline\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) can probably be used for this.","closedAt":null,"comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185NDUrX","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Good idea, I'd just note that we're reserving major versions for history incompatible changes, our minor releases may contain API breaking changes.","createdAt":"2022-10-26T22:12:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/938#issuecomment-1292716759","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-10-26T20:36:01Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":938,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Formally validate public API modification between releases","updatedAt":"2022-10-26T22:12:05Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/938"}
