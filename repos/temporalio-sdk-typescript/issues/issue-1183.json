However, as part of the test cleanup when performing `worker.shutdown()` Jest exists with `Exit Code 1` and it fails the whole test suite with an exception.\r\n\r\n`[ERROR] Worker failed { error: [Error [ShutdownError]: ShutDown] }` \r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWas running `1.8.1` for the packages mentioned below, \r\n\r\n```json\r\n    \"@temporalio/activity\": \"^1.8.1\",\r\n    \"@temporalio/client\": \"^1.8.1\",\r\n    \"@temporalio/common\": \"^1.8.1\",\r\n    \"@temporalio/worker\": \"^1.8.1\",\r\n    \"@temporalio/workflow\": \"^1.8.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever downgrading it to `1.7.4` fixes the issue. Is this a known bug?\r\n\r\n### Environment/Versions\r\n\r\n<!-- Please complete the following information where relevant. -->\r\n\r\n- OS and processor: Linux & MacOS\r\n- Temporal Version: 1.21.0\r\n- Are you using Docker or Kubernetes or building Temporal from source?
