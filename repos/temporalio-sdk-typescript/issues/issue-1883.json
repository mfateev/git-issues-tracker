There is documentation indicating that this should be possible:\n\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/330fdec7baa69da8658387c8a61085dd889aa6e3/packages/client/src/index.ts#L4\n\n### Environment/Versions\n\nTemporal Version: npm:1.8.6\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2026-01-12T19:46:28Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1883,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Bug] operatorService not accessible on `ConnectionLike`","updatedAt":"2026-01-12T19:46:28Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1883"}
