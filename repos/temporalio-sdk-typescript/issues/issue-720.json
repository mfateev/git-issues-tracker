I think it would be nice to have one place that re-exports all possible errors, so there is no need to import from \"internal-workflow-common\" at all.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nI think that being able to import the errors from a single module would be great:\r\n```\r\nconst {\r\n  WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError,\r\n  WorkflowNotFoundError,\r\n} = require('@temporalio/client'); // it doesn't necessarily have to be exported from the client module directly, that's just an example\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nI am using the `WorkflowNotFoundError` when checking errors due to invalid commands - like sending a signal to an already finished workflow. For example:\r\n```\r\nconst handle = this.client.getHandle(id);\r\ntry {\r\n\tawait handle.signal(CANCEL_SIGNAL_NAME, {});\r\n} catch (err) {\r\n\tif (err instanceof WorkflowNotFoundError) {\r\n\t\t// handle this errors in a proper manner, so that it is not retried from the outside.\r\n\t}\r\n        // all unknown errors are retried\r\n\tthrow err;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closedAt":"2022-06-29T22:13:25Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185Fe-NB","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We could easily re-export it, thanks for reporting.","createdAt":"2022-06-24T16:40:47Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/720#issuecomment-1165747009","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-06-24T13:21:11Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":720,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] `WorkflowNotFoundError` export is not consistent with `WorkflowExecutionAlreadyStartedError` ","updatedAt":"2022-06-29T22:13:25Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/720"}
