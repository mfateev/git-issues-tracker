For example, activities are automatically considered started when a poll request returns and if the worker is busy it might not actually start them in time.","closedAt":"2021-03-18T15:54:55Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2021-03-11T07:06:23Z","labels":[],"milestone":null,"number":33,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"Don't buffer poll results in core-lang bridge (lib.rs)","updatedAt":"2021-03-18T15:54:55Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/33"}
