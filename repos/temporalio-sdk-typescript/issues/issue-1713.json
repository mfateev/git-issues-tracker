This may cause issues as the caller may wrongly use a webpack version different from the one used by `@temporalio/worker`.\n\nIdeally, we can do something like this:\n```ts\nwebpackConfigHook(config, webpack) {\n  // ... do something with webpack, such as \n  config.plugins.push(\n      new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n          'someValue': {},\n      })\n  )\n\n  return config\n}\n```\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-05-10T22:47:20Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1713,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Pass webpack obj as the second parameter when calling webpackConfigHook","updatedAt":"2025-05-10T22:47:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1713"}
