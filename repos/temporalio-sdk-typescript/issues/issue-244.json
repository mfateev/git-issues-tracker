It should have been on version `0.6.0` by now.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm thinking it might make more sense to have a single version for all of the packages in the mono-repo.\r\n\r\nlerna changelog seems to be broken, `feat!` commits are being classified as bug fixes and the changelog messages are duplicated across any package that was part of the commit that changed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-node/commit/23da8507a90049774cc6ddd28a8ec3dfc37d345f#diff-639cb7cb3eda69b4a479a3a8e11c556d1ac91b6ba1552785fd17fb5970f67150\r\n\r\nUsing a single version for all packages, we'll be able to get rid of all of the package specific changelogs and get rid the duplication.\r\n","closedAt":"2022-09-08T00:16:19Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1844B0rD","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"If we're doing a single version for all packages, we can remove the `protos` dependency on `core-bridge` and close #172.","createdAt":"2021-10-11T12:53:09Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/244#issuecomment-940001987","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1844HHT1","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We now have a single version for all packages and a single changelog, much better!\r\nAs discussed on slack with @Sushisource, we'll drop the conventional commit CI check and only check that PR titles follow the convention.\r\nRight before the PR is merged there's a window to break the convention if the title is edited but we won't go that far to enforce conventions.\r\nBefore releasing we'll still want to manually edit the CHANGLOG, so this is not as critical as it was when lerna auto-generated changlogs.","createdAt":"2021-10-12T19:51:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/244#issuecomment-941389045","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1844HKEg","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We'll also probably want to disable rebase and merge and only use squash commits","createdAt":"2021-10-12T19:54:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/244#issuecomment-941400352","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1844Ky2k","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Removed the beta milestone because the important part has been done already.","createdAt":"2021-10-13T14:17:15Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/244#issuecomment-942353828","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185J6ZNs","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Our current process is good enough, we can add a CI step to validate the PR title but it's overkill IMHO, we end up manually editing the auto-generated CHANGELOG anyways.","createdAt":"2022-09-08T00:16:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/244#issuecomment-1240044396","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-09-15T09:46:10Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":244,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] Auto generated changelogs and versions are not working as intended","updatedAt":"2022-09-08T00:16:19Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/244"}
