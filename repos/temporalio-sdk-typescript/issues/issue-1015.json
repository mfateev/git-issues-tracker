Please describe.\n\nNeed opt-in catch-alls for workflows, activities, signals, queries, and updates.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nShould be able to register only one workflow as \"dynamic\" and it is given the name as a string as the first arg, then args as an array as the second arg. In other SDKs we give the second arg as still-serialized payloads because they need the type to deserialize, but since JS doesn't, can already be deserialized.\n\nNeed to do the same for activity.\n\nFor signal handler, should allow user to register only one catch-all that not only drains all unhandled-yet-buffered when registered, but then gets each unhandled signal after that. The function should get the signal name and the args.\n\nNeed to do the same for query and update.\n\nSeems an early proposal on this is already at #973. Incorporate as needed.\n\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] Workflows: #1038\n- [x] Signals: #1038 \n- [x] Queries: #1639\n- [x] Updates: not implemented yet\n- [x] Activities: not implemented yet\n","closedAt":"2025-05-03T03:50:59Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185SiHmv","author":{"login":"mjameswh"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Also related: #846","createdAt":"2023-01-16T23:44:12Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1015#issuecomment-1384675759","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2023-01-05T13:46:46Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1015,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Support dynamic workflows, activities, signals, queries, and updates","updatedAt":"2025-05-30T06:47:40Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1015"}
