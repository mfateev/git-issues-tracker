Please describe.\n\nTemporal SDK silently ignores the error when the upstream exporter fails to export the spans. I ran into a issue that the `RunWorkflow` span is not exported when the upstream gRPC otel exporter was misconfigured (`concurrentLimit` was set to 1). The problem is otel exporter returns the error through the callback function while temporal sdk just ignores it which makes it harder to debug.\n\n- https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/5ff22f0f7f0ac9ed543bbd5dea3f6205cadafff5/packages/interceptors-opentelemetry/src/worker/index.ts#L86\n\n- https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/6f753cca7e48466d8dad1ddf372f0e6caa60c256/experimental/packages/otlp-exporter-base/src/otlp-export-delegate.ts#L62\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAdd an optional callback parameter to the `makeWorkflowExporter`, and just pass it to the upstream exporter as its callback. This is the easiest solution. User will at least have a way to know about the error. We can also have a default implementation for it. Take `SimpleSpanProcessor` as an example, the default can just be [`globalErrorHandler`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/6f753cca7e48466d8dad1ddf372f0e6caa60c256/packages/opentelemetry-sdk-trace-base/src/export/SimpleSpanProcessor.ts#L65).\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nIt will be an API change, but shouldn't be a breaking change, since the new callback parameter will be optional.\n\nI can help to add this if you think this is a good approach.
