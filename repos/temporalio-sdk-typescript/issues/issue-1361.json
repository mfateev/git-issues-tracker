Please describe.\r\n\r\nWe created a Slack bot for automation. Those automation are backed by Temporal. Many teams may contribute to this bot. I would like to add a prefix to each activity and workflow. like `slack.postMessage`. so when people look at temporal web ui, they can clearly know what each activity is doing.\r\n\r\nFor activities, It is possible to maintain a map.\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as slack from \"./slack/activities\"\r\nconst activities = {\r\n  \"slack.postMessage\": slack.postMessage\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever, it is not possible to do it for workflows in worker. \r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n```typescript\r\nconst worker = await Worker.create({\r\n    connection: conn,\r\n    namespace: config.temporal.namespaces.default,\r\n    workflowsPath: require.resolve(\"./workflows/workflows.generated\"),\r\n    // workflowNameResolver: myCustomResolver,\r\n    activities: flattenPackageActivities(packageInfos),\r\n    taskQueue: config.temporal.queues.default,\r\n\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nmyCustomResolver.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction myCustomResolver(workflowName: string): string {\r\n  return workflowName.split(\".\").join()...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n","closedAt":"2024-04-04T18:44:04Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1850gCZB","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"You can build this yourself by leveraging the `default` export.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// workflows.generated.ts\r\nexport default async function (...args: unknown[]): Promise<unknown> {\r\n  const { workflowType } = workflowInfo();\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that if you want to use the typed client interface, you won't be able to use `client.workflow.start(someFunction, ...)`, you'll need to specify both the workflow name and the function type via generics to match the name you want to expose on the workflow side.","createdAt":"2024-02-20T16:12:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1361#issuecomment-1954555457","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1855eJZq","author":{"login":"mjameswh"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Closing: feature is already supported.","createdAt":"2024-04-04T18:44:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1361#issuecomment-2037945962","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2024-02-17T04:51:08Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1361,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Custom Workflow/Activity Resolver","updatedAt":"2024-04-04T18:44:04Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1361"}
