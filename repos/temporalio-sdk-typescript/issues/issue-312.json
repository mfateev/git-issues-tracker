But if the language doesn't have a wrapper for stubs (like Java does), this method may be on WorkflowClient.\r\n\r\nIssues for other SDKs:\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java/issues/828\r\nhttps://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/issues/595","closedAt":"2022-10-11T23:20:01Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185Hx0TG","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"We probably won't expose this on `WorkflowClient`, there's a plan to add a \"meta\" `Client` that will contain the more specific clients.","createdAt":"2022-08-03T17:08:33Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/312#issuecomment-1204241606","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185MBPdE","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"This is now exposed via the raw gRPC client.","createdAt":"2022-10-11T23:20:01Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/312#issuecomment-1275393860","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185ejjW9","author":{"login":"clintonb"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"@bergundy can you provide an example of how to use this, please?","createdAt":"2023-06-11T23:32:20Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/312#issuecomment-1586378173","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185ekKFE","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"See https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/client.Connection#healthservice.\r\nIf you can’t make sense out of that I can post the example","createdAt":"2023-06-12T04:00:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/312#issuecomment-1586536772","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185hBpEA","author":{"login":"AlexHayton"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I have tried to implement it based on the docs but getting stuck at `grpc.health.v1.Health.create()` - @bergundy  if it's not too much trouble, please could you post your example?
