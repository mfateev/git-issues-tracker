Though it works with appropriate setup (eg. we have a sample demonstrating that it works), some users are struggling at replicating that \"winning combination\" in their own project, despite considerable efforts and willingness to accept applicable constraints (eg. use Mocha or AVA, ts-node rather than ts-mocha or similar, pre-transpile TS code to pure-JS, hardcode workflow name in their test files to avoid importing wokrlfow.ts from tests, etc).\r\n\r\n### What need to be done\r\n\r\nThis situation can be improved from two sides:\r\n1. Improve the tool itself so that it is less fragile / more resilient to changes in its runtime environment\r\n2.
