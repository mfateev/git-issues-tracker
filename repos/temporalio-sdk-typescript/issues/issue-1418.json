Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently it's a bit clumsy to fail a workflow from within an update. You have to set a flag in your updateMethod, and then in the workflow code watch for that flag and throw the failure from there (according to [this post](https://community.temporal.io/t/fail-workflow-form-updatemethod/11441/3) re: the java sdk at least).\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n`throw ApplicationFailure` should return (or at least have the option to return) `WorkflowFailedError` instead of `WorkflowUpdateFailedError`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThere is a similar issue active in the Java SDK repo: https://github.com/temporalio/features/issues/650\r\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-05-14T04:04:46Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1418,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Failures thrown from within the update handler should be able to fail the workflow","updatedAt":"2024-05-14T04:04:46Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1418"}
