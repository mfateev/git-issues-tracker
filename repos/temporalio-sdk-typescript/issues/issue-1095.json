Please describe.\r\n\r\nOur logs are littered with Webpack stats that aren't useful under normal circumstances. The color codes (enabled by default, with no option to disable) make the logs difficult to read in third-party logging systems (GCP Logs, in my case). Printing the logs across multiple lines is wasting money (very small, but still annoying) when exporting to systems that charge by the log line.\r\n\r\nI wasted about an hour trying to configure Webpack via `webpackConfigHook` before looking at the code and learning the SDK is doing this, not Webpack.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAllow stats to be controlled via [Webpack's existing stats configuration](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/stats/). At a minimum, document the fact that these log lines cannot be toggled.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
