Please describe.\r\n\r\n[xstate](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate) is a very useful library for implementing state machines in TypeScript codebases. There is a specific feature that is particularly prudent to my usecase - `fromPromise`. Internally this uses an `AbortController` as part of it's implementation (see [here](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/blob/65088b6a595a0c69f312fec5f91916e1dbc81b46/packages/core/src/actors/promise.ts#L184)). In the same vein as #1550, I have a patch locally that exposes AbortController to the vm sandbox, and everything seems to work fine (at least for my usage of xstate currently). From reading [the docs](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#class-abortcontroller) this seems like a perfectly safe API to expose to the sandbox.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nExpose `AbortController` to the worker workflow sandbox.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n","closedAt":"2024-12-18T20:07:18Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-11-15T18:39:58Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1564,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Expose `AbortController` in Workflow sandbox","updatedAt":"2024-12-18T20:07:18Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1564"}
