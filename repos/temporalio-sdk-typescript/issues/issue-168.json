I interpret this as a scoped import, declared as a dependency in package.json. I'd prefer if this were changed to something unambiguous and preferably explicit.\r\n\r\nI'm also not keen about the automatic imports from the working directory. This seems concise and convenient for starter apps, but I want to see a more verbose and flexible layer provided for advanced users. Ideally, the simple style would be built on the complex layer.","createdAt":"2021-08-17T09:43:07Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/168#issuecomment-900150052","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1841qQds","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"@joebowbeer I agree, this will change in the very near future.","createdAt":"2021-08-17T12:50:46Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/168#issuecomment-900269932","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-07-26T07:41:21Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":2,"title":"beta","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":168,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Discuss activity registration and imports","updatedAt":"2021-08-31T10:30:19Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/168"}
