Please describe.\n\n**Security Risk**: When a `handle` object is accidentally passed to serialization layers (e.g., JSON.stringify, logging frameworks, or HTTP responses), it exposes the internal `client` reference which contains:\n- Unmasked API keys\n- Authentication credentials\n- Other sensitive configuration data\n\nThere might be more objects with references to the client or other objects with sensitive fields.\n\nThis creates a critical security vulnerability where sensitive information can be leaked through:\n- Application logs\n- HTTP response bodies\n- Error messages\n- Debug outputs\n\nWhile `handle` objects are not intended to be serialized or returned in responses, human errors are inevitable, and this risk could be mitigated at the SDK level.\n\n**Example scenario:**\n```javascript\n// Accidental exposure risk\napp.get('/status', (req, res) => {\n res.json({ \n   workflowStatus: 'running',\n   handle: workflowHandle // ops, this could expose API keys if serialized with something like superjson\n });\n});\n```\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n1. **Implement custom serialization behavior** for objects containing sensitive data:\n  - Override `toJSON()` methods to exclude or mask sensitive fields\n  - Add serialization guards that prevent accidental exposure\n\n2. **Redesign the data model** for sensitive information:\n  - Consider using structures that prevent the serialization of its content\n\n3. **Handle advanced serialization libraries**:\n  - Account for libraries like `superjson` that to some extent bypass standard JS serialization\n  - Implement deeper protection mechanisms that work across different serialization methods\n\n### Additional context\n\n**Current behavior problems:**\n\n**Version**: @temporalio/client - 1.11.2\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-07-01T15:11:48Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1736,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Mask/sanitize client sensitive data references","updatedAt":"2025-07-01T15:11:48Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1736"}
