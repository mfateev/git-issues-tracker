Basically, the latest release of GHA’s Runner agent ignores the fact that an action is requesting node16, and instead just calls node20 anyway. \r\n\r\nUntil now, we were relying on GLIBC 2.24 Docker images or runners in very specific places to ensure that the native artifacts included in our official SDK releases would run on some older Linux distros that some of our customers were still using.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that Node20 is incompatible with GLIBC 2.27 or earlier, this no longer works, and our CI workflows are now failing.","closedAt":"2024-12-03T05:30:59Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2024-11-26T23:01:54Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1575,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] CI build is broken due to GHA dropping support for node16-based actions","updatedAt":"2024-12-03T05:30:59Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1575"}
