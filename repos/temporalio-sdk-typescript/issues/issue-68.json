Do what we do in [Java](https://docs.temporal.io/docs/java-versioning) and record a marker in the WF history.\r\n2. Bundle workflows with their dependencies using a bundler such as [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and include all workflow relevant versions in the worker's workflows directory.\r\n3. Keep using modules and add versioning capabilities to the loader (requires a way to store loaded modules).","closedAt":"2021-08-24T13:15:27Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1841bVQt","author":{"login":"Sushisource"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"See https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core/pull/156","createdAt":"2021-08-10T22:38:26Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/68#issuecomment-896357421","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-04-20T13:33:08Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":{"number":2,"title":"beta","description":"","dueOn":null},"number":68,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Support workflow versioning","updatedAt":"2021-08-24T13:15:27Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/68"}
