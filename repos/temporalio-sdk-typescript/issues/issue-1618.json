We certainly hope that we'll reach that objective at some point in the future, but we are not actively working in that direction just now. It is simply too early for that.\n\nFor example, the specific issue you describe is due to a difference in [how bun checks the `error` argument on `napi_throw`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/1fa42d81af0806cf06ca9dc050bf06046c3a4b41/src/bun.js/bindings/napi.cpp#L1644-L1659) vs [what's done in Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/5fad0b93667ffc6e4def52996b9529ac99b26319/src/js_native_api_v8.cc#L1924-L1934). That breaks the method that [Neon Binding](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon/blob/7f4feb10631cfd3e654112d42a3b5ed472f851e8/crates/neon/src/sys/no_panic.rs#L135-L137) uses to check either it is safe to call back into the JS environment at that time.\n\nIt is not worth fixing that issue in upstream projects just yet. Bun's team is already doing some awesome bug hunting work on their NAPI implementation. See for example [this PR](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/14501) and [this one](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/16230). I'd expect a few rounds like these, so let's give them time to complete their efforts first, and then for other key dependencies to stabilize.","createdAt":"2025-01-31T23:50:18Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1618#issuecomment-2628581937","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2025-01-31T12:32:47Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDA2","name":"bug","description":"Something isn't working","color":"d73a4a"}],"milestone":null,"number":1618,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Bug] on using bun not able to connect temporal","updatedAt":"2025-02-07T15:54:58Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1618"}
