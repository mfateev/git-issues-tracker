Please describe.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I import the package `crypto` in every file where I start a workflow, it creates redundant code where I need to set the parameter `workflowId` to `crypto.randomUUID()`\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nIt will be nice to have `workflowId` default's value to `crypto.randomUUID()`. Removes some redundant code\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThere probably was a reason to remove the default value of `workflowId` but I don't know why (#387)\r\n","closedAt":"2022-02-01T04:02:05Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1849CAmm","author":{"login":"lorensr"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Pro of having a default is, as you say, that it makes random ID code shorter/simpler. \r\n\r\nWe used to have a default. I think it was removed in an effort to guide users toward using business-meaningful IDs instead of random IDs. Would that make sense to do in your use case? The benefits are:\r\n\r\n- Can reduce risk of duplicate Workflows. For instance, if I want to make one Workflow per order, I'd use the `orderId`. Then, if it's still running and I try to create it again, it will fail.\r\n- Removes the need to (and possible problems around) storing the generated `workflowId`.\r\n- Easier to look up Workflow.\r\n\r\nI'm personally inclined toward:\r\n\r\n- Having a default uuidv4\r\n- Using a business meaningful ID in all or most of the docs and samples\r\n\r\nThen we both guide people toward using business IDs **and** allow users for whom UUIDs make sense to write simple/non-redundant code.","createdAt":"2022-01-28T06:54:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/454#issuecomment-1023936934","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1849Fuy0","author":{"login":"swyxio"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"we had considered offering a default random id function but also rejected the idea given its not that useful. see internal slack","createdAt":"2022-01-29T13:31:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/454#issuecomment-1024912564","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1849Lnch","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I don't see us reverting back to providing a default `workflowId`, the rationale is in the PR linked above.\r\nYou should always use meaningful business IDs for workflow IDs in real world scenarios and the API should lead users in that direction.","createdAt":"2022-02-01T04:02:02Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/454#issuecomment-1026455329","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2022-01-27T13:54:53Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":454,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Add default value to workflowId","updatedAt":"2022-02-01T04:02:05Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/454"}
