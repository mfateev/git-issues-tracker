We certainly could have a `logFriendly(failure)` helper, or `console.log(failure.pretty())`, and try to teach people it exists via API ref and docs.","createdAt":"2022-07-28T17:26:32Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/777#issuecomment-1198433467","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx185LbJFx","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"I don’t think we’re going to do this.
