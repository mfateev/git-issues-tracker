This program would also make it easy to update/set version number on all `@temporalio/*` dependencies in the project.\n\n","closedAt":null,"comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-05-02T19:27:43Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1113,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"OPEN","title":"[Feature Request] Create a `npx @temporalio/doctor` command","updatedAt":"2025-02-07T03:49:31Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1113"}
