It's also not available in @temporalio/client, which is the other place I'd expect it. Following the instructions from the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#features-1), I'm opening this bug to track re-exporting the type.\r\n\r\n<!-- If applicable, add screenshots or code blocks to help explain your problem.
