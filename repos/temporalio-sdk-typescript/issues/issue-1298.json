Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently the SDK has two separate connection classes:\r\n\r\n1. `NativeConnection` which is a JS representation of the Rust client object used to power workers.\r\n2. `Connection` a grpc-js backed object that can only be used to power clients.\r\n\r\nThis is unnecessarily confusing and is blocking adding features such as:\r\n1. exposing the worker's connection to activity implementations.\r\n2. eager workflow start.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nMerge the two classes.\r\n\r\n`Connection` is the preferred implementation as it supports grpc interceptors and does not require any native code making it slimmer and better suited for client applications especially in FaaS platforms where the native code what increase the function size and increase cold start times.\r\nAbstracting the Rust client trait takes us a step forward towards compiling Rust Core to WASM, which opens up supporting other JS runtimes with great ease.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nNote that the `Connection` class does not record any metrics, that is a prerequisite for this issue.","closedAt":"2025-07-01T20:49:36Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2023-11-20T20:51:01Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1298,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Support using the pure JS `Connection` to power a `Worker`","updatedAt":"2025-07-03T19:18:10Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1298"}
