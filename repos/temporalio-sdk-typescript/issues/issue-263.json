Please describe.\r\n\r\nIn the other SDKs there's a way to dynamically add signal handlers during Workflow execution.\r\nThis is useful for building DSLs on top of Temporal and can enable high level abstractions such as an awaitable Signal object (see @sw-yx's API [proposal](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/333f14872482f6190bda482a275b1f48#file-3-signals-receiving-data-ts-L34)).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const unblockWithSignal = async () => {\r\n  let isBlocked = new QueryVariable('isBlocked', true /* initial value */);\r\n  await new Signal('unblock');\r\n  isBlocked.value = false;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nexpose 2 new functions in the `@temporalio/workflow` module:\r\n\r\n`registerSignalHandler` and `registerQueryHandler`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nNote that using dynamic handlers implies loosing type safety when interacting with the Workflow via a handle.\r\nThis feature does not go into type safety or an alternative Workflow API, it is only mentioned here to explain the possibilities that open up.","closedAt":"2021-10-12T16:12:53Z","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1843NEeK","author":{"login":"swyxio"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"i think we are more agreed on the query stuff than the signals api but yes!","createdAt":"2021-09-23T21:25:16Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/263#issuecomment-926173066","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOEujx1844GPiw","author":{"login":"bergundy"},"authorAssociation":"MEMBER","body":"Not relevant anymore, we only have dynamic registration now.","createdAt":"2021-10-12T16:12:53Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/263#issuecomment-941160624","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"createdAt":"2021-09-23T08:25:55Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":263,"reactionGroups":[],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Dynamic Workflow signal and query handler registration","updatedAt":"2021-10-12T16:12:53Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/263"}
