Please describe.\n\nWe're currently spawning a global TestWorkflowEnvironment for our integration tests. As we can't pass the connection/nativeConnection directly onwards we have to pass the address to the application itself. Unfortunately it's not possible to query the actual address string including the port, when spawning the TestWorkflowEnvironment via [createLocal](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/testing.TestWorkflowEnvironment#createlocal) when using a [random free port](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/interfaces/testing.DevServerConfig#port).\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] -->\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nAllow querying the port/address so it's possible to use a random free port when creating clients manually.\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. SCREENSHOTS OR CODE SAMPLES ARE VERY HELPFUL -->\n\n### Workaround\n```typescript\nconst env = await TestWorkflowEnvironment.createLocal()\nconst address = native.ephemeralServerGetTarget(env[\"server\"])\n``` \n","closedAt":"2025-11-03T16:59:26Z","comments":[],"createdAt":"2025-09-19T10:40:11Z","labels":[{"id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTQ1Mzg0MDEz","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"}],"milestone":null,"number":1787,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"state":"CLOSED","title":"[Feature Request] Allow querying the port/address via TestWorkflowEnvironment","updatedAt":"2025-11-03T16:59:26Z","url":"https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript/issues/1787"}
