  "rootCause": "Connection retry logic was not fully implemented in gRPC interceptors; individual calls may fail after retry limit is hit even though the connection can be reused.",

  "keyQuote": "you can trust the Connection and WorkflowClient instance may be re-used though, depending on your retry policy, in-progress calls may eventually fail if the connection is lost for long enough",
