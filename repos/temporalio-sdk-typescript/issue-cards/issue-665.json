  "summary": "Users find it difficult to mock SDK functions in tests. Current mocking approaches (Jest, Sinon) don't work well with the SDK's export structure, and testing workflows requires setting up a full Worker and test client, which is cumbersome for unit testing.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Developers struggle to write simple unit tests for workflows and helper functions without setting up complex Worker infrastructure, leading to slower test iteration and lower test coverage.",
  "rootCause": "SDK doesn't provide built-in mocking utilities and the architectural design (no default exports, complex internal state management) makes standard mocking libraries ineffective.",
  "proposedFix": "Add built-in mocking support, possibly: 1) allow mocks to be passed directly to Worker.create(), 2) create first-class mocking utilities that work with standard mocking frameworks, 3) support local activities that don't produce markers for mocking child workflows.",
  "workaround": "Use a Worker with test connection and mock activities, or register helper functions as workflows and execute them via workflowClient.",
