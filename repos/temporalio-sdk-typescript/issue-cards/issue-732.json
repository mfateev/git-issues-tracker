  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot currently include activity/workflow input and output data in OpenTelemetry spans, limiting observability and analysis capabilities in monitoring platforms.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Add optional `attributes` field to `InstrumentOptions` to allow passing `SpanAttributes` to span creation, with optional global `includeAttributes` configuration flag in interceptor initialization.",
  "workaround": "Manually set span attributes in custom interceptor implementations using `span?.setAttributes()` method as shown in community responses.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Community provided workaround through interceptor implementation pattern; issue appears resolved through documentation/sample updates.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Looking at the opentelemetry sdk, `tracer.startActiveSpan` has another available signature where you can pass in a `SpanOptions` object and this has a field called `attributes`",
