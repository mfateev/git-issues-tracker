  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users must manually handle proto3-compliant JSON serialization, requiring extra setup code and workarounds like proto3-json-serializer instead of using protobufjs's native methods.",
  "rootCause": "protobufjs library's `.toJSON` implementation does not follow Google's proto3 JSON specification, unlike Google's own protobuf libraries used by other SDKs.",
  "proposedFix": "Either fix protobufjs's `toJSON` implementation or add a `toProto3JSON` method; alternatively support static generated messages for binary/protobuf encoding.",
  "workaround": "Use proto3-json-serializer library as an external serialization workaround in the data converter.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as not an actionable issue for the SDK repo - it's an external protobufjs limitation. The current workaround using proto3-json-serializer is acceptable and handles serialization transparently for users.",
