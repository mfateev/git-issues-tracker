  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily export SDK metrics like ScheduleToStart to statsd/Datadog without additional infrastructure overhead.",
  "rootCause": "TypeScript SDK lacks native statsd exporter support, unlike Java/Go SDKs which use Tally libraries with statsd connectors.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide metrics export capabilities from SDK with statsd connector support, potentially through OpenTelemetry collectors or direct statsd export.",
  "workaround": "Deploy OpenTelemetry Collector as intermediate service to bridge metrics, though this adds operational complexity.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Team decided metrics export through OpenTelemetry Collector is more flexible and sustainable than embedding direct statsd support across all SDKs.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The big problem here is that we emit metrics from both Core and Lang. Every direct export we support it needs to exist in Core and all langs",
