  "userImpact": "Users are unable to reuse workflow IDs for new executions and receive confusing error messages that don't point to the actual root cause.",
  "rootCause": "The error was not from starting a new workflow with a duplicate ID, but from calling signal() on a completed workflow execution. The error message was misleading about the actual source.",

  "workaround": "Verify that signal() is not being called on completed workflows; the ALLOW_DUPLICATE policy works correctly for starting new workflows.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was not a bug in the SDK but user error - the error originated from calling signal() on a completed workflow, not from workflow creation with duplicate IDs.",

  "keyQuote": "From `at Object.signal` in the trace, it looks like the error is actually coming from calling `handle.signal()`?",
