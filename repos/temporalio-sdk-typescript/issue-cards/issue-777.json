  "summary": "Feature request to include string representations of enums in failure objects for better debuggability. Currently, enum values appear as numbers (e.g., `retryState: 4`), making it difficult for users to understand what the values mean.",

  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Add string enum representations alongside numeric values in failure objects (e.g., `retryStateString: 'MAXIMUM_ATTEMPTS_REACHED'`), or provide a helper function like `logFriendly(failure)` or `failure.pretty()`.",
