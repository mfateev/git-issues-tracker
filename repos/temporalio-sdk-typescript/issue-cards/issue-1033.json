  "summary": "TypeScript SDK client crashes silently when directly awaiting promises from methods like `client.workflow.start()`. The issue occurs due to a gRPC-js dependency version problem that causes the Node.js process to exit prematurely when async operations complete.",

  "rootCause": "Incompatible @grpc/grpc-js versions (1.8.0-1.8.6) causing the Node.js process to exit prematurely when awaiting promises returned from Client methods",
  "proposedFix": "Update @grpc/grpc-js dependency to version 1.8.7 or later, which fixes the underlying gRPC-js issue",
  "workaround": "Avoid directly awaiting client promises; use Promise.all() with a delay, or add a ref to keep the event loop alive (e.g., setInterval with large timeout)",

  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed in SDK version 1.8.7 by updating @grpc/grpc-js dependency. Issue was related to grpc-node#2318.",
