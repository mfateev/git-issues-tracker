  "summary": "Feature request to add native sticky sessions support to the TypeScript SDK to ensure all tasks of a workflow execute on the same worker, enabling workflows with local state. Closed as duplicate of temporalio/features#562 with indication that sessions will be redesigned across all SDKs.",
  "category": "feature",
  "subcategory": "sticky-sessions",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users needing workflows with local state must implement manual sticky execution mechanisms instead of having native SDK support like Go SDK provides.",
  "rootCause": "TypeScript SDK lacks native sticky sessions implementation that Go SDK has, forcing users to build custom solutions.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement native sticky sessions in TypeScript SDK based on reference implementation using WorkerRegistrationService, HeartbeatService, and WorkflowBalancerService with worker capacity tracking.",
  "workaround": "Use Worker Specific Task Queue pattern as mentioned in samples, though it requires complex user-land implementation with limited concurrency control.",
  "resolution": "duplicate",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as duplicate of temporalio/features#562. Team acknowledged the feature's value but declined this specific implementation, indicating sessions will be redesigned holistically across all SDKs when implemented.",
  "related": [

  "keyQuote": "So yes, we do intend to add Sessions support at some point. And when we do, we'll add it to _all_ of our official SDKs, not only TypeScript.",
