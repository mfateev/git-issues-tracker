  "summary": "Worker performance degrades significantly over time during high-concurrency workload execution, with throughput dropping from ~100 WFs/s to ~10 WFs/s. Investigation identified that the SDK was leaking isolate references, causing memory pressure and CPU overhead.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users running high-throughput workflows experience dramatic performance degradation over time, making the SDK unsuitable for sustained workloads.",
  "rootCause": "SDK was leaking isolate references during workflow activation, causing memory pressure and preventing proper garbage collection.",
  "proposedFix": "Fix pending - requires proper cleanup and disposal of workflow isolate context references after activation.",
  "workaround": "Use a larger pool of isolates (e.g., 8 instead of 1) to reduce degradation severity, though this doesn't eliminate the problem.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Isolate reference leak was identified and fixed through proper lifecycle management of workflow isolate contexts.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "After further investigation, seems like the cause was the SDK leaking isolate references.",
