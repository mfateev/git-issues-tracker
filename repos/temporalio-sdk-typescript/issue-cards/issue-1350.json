  "userImpact": "Users cannot install or upgrade @temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry v1.9.0 due to unresolvable peer dependency conflicts, blocking their ability to use OpenTelemetry integration with the updated SDK.",
  "rootCause": "The interceptors-opentelemetry package was published with peer dependency declarations using file:// references instead of version number ranges, making it incompatible with npm's dependency resolver when other packages were upgraded to v1.9.0.",
  "proposedFix": "Update the peer dependency declarations in the package to use proper version ranges instead of file references, as fixed in v1.9.1.",
  "workaround": "Use npm install with --force or --legacy-peer-deps flags to bypass the dependency check.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Published version 1.9.1 which corrects the peer dependency declarations, allowing normal installation without workarounds.",
