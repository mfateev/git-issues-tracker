  "summary": "SignalDefinition and QueryDefinition discard their type parameter information due to structural typing, allowing type-unsafe assignments like SignalDefinition<[string]> being assignable to SignalDefinition<[number]>. This request proposes using a unique symbol type brand to preserve type information for improved type-level reasoning in helper functions.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot reliably use type-level logic with signal/query definitions for helper utilities and type algebra due to structural typing allowing incorrect type substitutions.",
  "rootCause": "SignalDefinition and QueryDefinition don't preserve the _Args type parameter in the resulting type, making them structurally compatible with different argument types.",
  "proposedFix": "Introduce a unique symbol type brand (argsBrand) as a virtual property on SignalDefinition and QueryDefinition to preserve type information without runtime overhead.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was closed after the feature was implemented, likely incorporating the type brand solution to preserve argument type information.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "This brand doesn't exist at run-time, and since the symbol is not exported it is not possible for consumers to access the \"virtual\" property.",
