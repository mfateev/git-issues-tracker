  "userImpact": "Developers cannot properly log Error objects in activities, making debugging more difficult as stack traces are lost.",
  "rootCause": "The second argument to log.error() is treated as a metadata object rather than an error object, and the logging implementation does not serialize Error objects in metadata.",
  "proposedFix": "Wrap Error objects in a metadata object with an 'error' key: { error: new Error('...') }",
  "workaround": "Pass the Error object wrapped in a metadata object: Context.current().log.error('Kablamo!', { error: new Error('THIS IS AN ERROR!!!') })",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Marked as resolved through documentation/clarification - the API is working as designed, and the correct usage pattern was provided.",
