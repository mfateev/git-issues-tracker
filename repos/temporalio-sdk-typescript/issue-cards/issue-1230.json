  "summary": "User requested a `registerSearchAttribute` method on `TestWorkflowEnvironment` to register custom search attributes for testing, similar to the Java SDK. The issue was self-resolved when the user discovered the functionality already exists via `connection.operatorService.addSearchAttributes()`, but the API is poorly documented.",

  "rootCause": "The `operatorService.addSearchAttributes()` method exists but is not exposed on `TestWorkflowEnvironment` interface or documented, making it difficult for users to discover.",
  "proposedFix": "Add `registerSearchAttribute` method to `TestWorkflowEnvironment` interface as a convenience method, or improve documentation to reference the existing `operatorService.addSearchAttributes()` approach.",
  "workaround": "Use `temporalTestEnv.connection.operatorService.addSearchAttributes()` to register custom search attributes directly.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by improving documentation and exposing the existing operatorService.addSearchAttributes() API. User discovered the solution exists but is hidden.",
