  "userImpact": "Users cannot see workflow application logs at INFO level without enabling DEBUG logging, and this may cause memory leaks as log buffers grow unbounded.",
  "rootCause": "Log flushing issue in LogCollector where log entries are buffered but not properly propagated unless core logging filter is set to DEBUG or TRACE.",
