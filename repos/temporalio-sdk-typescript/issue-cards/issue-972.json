  "userImpact": "Users cannot accurately measure worker queue depth using the schedule-to-start latency metric when activities are retried, as the metric reports inflated values.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK calculates schedule-to-start latency using the activity's initial scheduled time rather than the current attempt's scheduled time, causing retried attempts to report the full time since the original scheduling.",

  "keyQuote": "after checking other SDKs, looks like they're using the `current_attempt_scheduled_time`.",
