  "summary": "Feature request to simplify protobuf payload converter usage by leveraging protobufjs's global module.roots field instead of requiring users to pass a root argument. This would reduce configuration complexity but requires compatible package manager setup and duplicate message name handling.",

  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users would have simpler protobuf integration without needing to pass root arguments to converters, but the feature was not completed due to bundle size concerns.",
  "rootCause": "Bundle size bloat when importing protobufjs/light directly into the default payload converter (increasing from 0.25 to 0.5 MB).",
  "proposedFix": "Use protobufjs global module.roots field to discover proto definitions instead of requiring explicit root argument, with requirements for package manager deduplication and pbjs code generation.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Feature was not completed due to bundle size implications. Importing protobufjs/light would double bundle size, and webpack integration would require complex hacks to conditionally load the dependency.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "It requires importing `protobufjs/light`, which doubles the bundle size (.25 to .5 MB)",
