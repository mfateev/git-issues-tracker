  "summary": "Worker processes continue running as orphaned processes after Ctrl+C interruption or ignore code changes during development, causing stale workers to persist. The issue is caused by the Runtime adding process signal listeners without registered callbacks, preventing proper signal handling.",

  "userImpact": "Developers experience stale worker processes continuing to run with outdated code during development workflows, causing unpredictable behavior.",
  "rootCause": "The Runtime's setupShutdownHook adds a listener to process signals before any shutdown callbacks are registered, which prevents the default signal behavior from triggering. Shutdown callbacks are only added after the worker starts, creating a race condition where early signals are ignored.",
  "proposedFix": "Patch Runtime to only add listener to process signal when there is a callback registered, or add a listener that always exits for development scenarios.",
  "workaround": "Manually manage process signal listeners or use development tooling workarounds to ensure workers properly terminate.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was resolved by improving signal handling in the Runtime to properly register and manage shutdown signal callbacks.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "When a listener to a process signal is added, the signal no longer causes the default behavior, so the signal is ignored.",
