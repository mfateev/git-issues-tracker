  "rootCause": "The architecture maintains two separate connection implementations (NativeConnection for workers, Connection for clients) causing confusion and architectural limitations.",
  "proposedFix": "Merge the two connection classes, use Connection as the base implementation since it supports gRPC interceptors and requires no native code, and add metrics recording to Connection.",
