  "summary": "Webpack bundling of workflow code fails when transitive dependencies pull in Node.js built-in modules or native code. The bundler incorrectly tries to resolve these modules, causing build failures even when they're not actually used at runtime.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot bundle workflow code that transitively depends on packages that use Node.js built-ins or native code, blocking legitimate use cases with monorepos and certain dependencies.",
  "rootCause": "Webpack defaults to browser target and tries to resolve all imported modules, including Node.js built-ins and native packages that aren't actually needed in the workflow sandbox context.",
  "proposedFix": "Add `target: 'node'` to webpack config, allow users to specify ignored modules via `BundleOptions.ignoreModules`, or provide webpack config override hooks. Stub modules approach used successfully for `assert` could be extended.",
  "workaround": "Import specific utilities directly rather than through barrel exports (e.g., import from `../api/models` instead of `../api/index`), though this is impractical at scale.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented ignoreModules configuration option in BundleOptions to allow users to exclude problematic transitive dependencies from bundling.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Webpack is sometime unable to determine that the external package is not actually required at runtime, and will therefore try to load it, causing a build failure.",
