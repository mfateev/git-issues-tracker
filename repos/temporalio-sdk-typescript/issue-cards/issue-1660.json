  "userImpact": "Users cannot describe schedules after they have been running for a period of time, preventing them from checking schedule status or making modifications.",
  "rootCause": "The Temporal Server's consistent query buffer for the schedule workflow fills up when too many queries are pending, potentially due to underpowered worker nodes or a bug in schedule workflow replay logic triggered by the specific schedule definition.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade Temporal server to the latest release; review cluster configuration and worker node capacity; examine the specific schedule definition that triggers the issue.",
