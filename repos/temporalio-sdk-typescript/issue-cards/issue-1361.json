  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users managing multi-team workflow repositories cannot easily namespace workflows with prefixes like activities, limiting organization in the Temporal Web UI.",
  "rootCause": "The Worker.create API supports custom activity mapping but lacks equivalent workflow name resolver functionality.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a workflowNameResolver option to Worker.create configuration that accepts a function to transform workflow names.",
  "workaround": "Build a default export wrapper function in workflows.generated.ts that uses workflowInfo() to intercept and route workflow types manually.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Feature is already supported by leveraging the default export pattern with workflowInfo() to implement custom name resolution without API changes.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "You can build this yourself by leveraging the `default` export... Note that if you want to use the typed client interface, you'll need to specify both the workflow name and the function type via generics.",
