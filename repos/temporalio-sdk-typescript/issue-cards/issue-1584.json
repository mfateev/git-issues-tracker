  "summary": "mTLS connection with NativeConnectionOptions throws 'NativeCertsNotFound' error after upgrading from SDK 1.11.3 to 1.11.5. The issue stems from SDK v1.11.5 switching from rustls built-in CAs to system-native certificate verification, requiring explicit CA certificates in slim Docker images.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users upgrading to SDK 1.11.5 experience broken mTLS connections in containerized environments, particularly with slim Docker images lacking system CA certificates.",
  "rootCause": "SDK 1.11.5 changed from using rustls built-in CAs to relying on system-native certificate verification via the OS, which requires root CA certificates to be present in the environment.",
  "proposedFix": null,
  "workaround": "Install CA certificates in the Docker image (via `apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates`) or copy custom CA to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue is by design - SDK 1.11.5 correctly delegates CA management to the OS. Users must ensure CA certificates are available in their deployment environment.",

  "keyQuote": "The reason that was working until TS SDK 1.11.3 is that we were previously relying on rustls's built-in CAs rather than the system-native ones, but that was incorrect.",
