  "userImpact": "Users experienced production outages when indirect dependencies introduced breaking changes, making the SDK unusable.",
  "rootCause": "Unpinned transitive dependency (unionfs ^4.4.0) allowed broken releases to be installed, causing module resolution failures.",
  "proposedFix": "Consider pinning all direct dependencies to exact versions, though this may not prevent transitive dependency issues; alternatively, users can vendor the SDK using package-lock.json.",
  "workaround": "Users can vendor the Temporal SDK and its dependencies locally by pointing to packages in a local directory, or use package-lock.json to lock transitive dependencies.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Determined that pinning dependencies would cause more harm than benefit to the community. Recommended solution is for users to vendor the SDK if they need strict dependency control.",
