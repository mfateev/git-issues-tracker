  "summary": "After upgrading from v1.11.8 to v1.13.2, OpenTelemetry instrumentation causes excessive CPU usage (up to 100%), which disappears when OTel is disabled. The issue appears related to changes between these versions, possibly involving the reusev8context option or lazy-loaded modules.",

  "rootCause": "Likely a lazy-loaded module added in v1.13.2 or interaction between OTel interceptors and reusev8context option, with additional regression in v1.13.2 vs v1.13.1.",
