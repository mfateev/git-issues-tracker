  "userImpact": "Users deploying Activity and Client components through different deployment systems are forced to adapt their deployment logic to accommodate an unnecessary file path requirement.",
  "rootCause": "Original design decision to keep payloadConverter APIs consistent across all contexts, requiring file paths everywhere due to Workflow sandbox constraints, even where not technically necessary.",
  "proposedFix": "Support pre-instantiated Payload Converters for Client and Activity-only workers; for Workflow workers, extract payload converter from workflow bundle by looking for a named export at `workflowsPath` or in the prebuilt bundle.",
