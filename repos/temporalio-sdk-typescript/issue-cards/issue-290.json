  "rootCause": "Worker enters FAILED state on transport errors during polling instead of attempting reconnection, with no retry mechanism for server unavailability.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement automatic reconnection logic similar to Go SDK; allow worker creation before server is available; gracefully handle transport errors during polling with retry attempts.",
