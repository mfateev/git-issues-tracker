  "userImpact": "Users need a convenient way to check if a workflow execution exists or is running without implementing complex search queries.",
  "rootCause": "The TypeScript SDK does not provide a high-level API for countWorkflowExecutions; users must use raw gRPC API which requires Elasticsearch and proper query syntax.",
  "proposedFix": "Provide a high-level SDK method wrapping countWorkflowExecutions similar to listWorkflowExecutions, or document the workaround using getHandle(workflowId).describe().",
  "workaround": "Use client.getHandle(workflowId).describe() and check status code for WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_STATUS_RUNNING to determine if workflow is executing.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue resolved through discussion; user found that getHandle(workflowId).describe() is the appropriate approach for checking workflow execution status in the SDK.",
