  "summary": "Feature request for adding AbortSignal or timeout support to client.result() to allow cancellation of result polling and prevent resource leaks. The user wanted to wait briefly for workflow completion without blocking indefinitely.",
  "category": "feature",

  "apis": [

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot cleanly cancel result polling, causing potential resource leaks when they need to impose custom timeouts on workflow result waits.",
  "rootCause": "The result() function implements an infinite polling loop with no mechanism for caller-initiated cancellation.",
  "proposedFix": "Accept an AbortSignal parameter in result() functions (e.g., handle.result({signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10000)})).",
  "workaround": "Use client.withTimeout() or client.withAbortSignal() methods to apply timeout/abort constraints to client requests including result().",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The feature was already implemented via client.withTimeout() and client.withAbortSignal() methods, which the maintainer pointed out as existing solutions.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "You can apply a timeout or an abort signal over any client request (including raw gRPC requests) by using the client.withTimeout(...) and client.withAbortSignal(...) methods.",
