  "summary": "Error \"failed to downcast any\" occurs when creating a Worker without passing a required NativeConnection parameter. The error message from the Rust bridge is unclear and lacks context about what input was invalid.",

  "userImpact": "Users deploying to Render or similar environments get cryptic error messages when misconfiguring Worker initialization, making it difficult to debug.",
  "rootCause": "Missing required NativeConnection parameter passed to Worker.create; the Rust bridge's downcast error doesn't indicate what was wrong or what was expected.",
  "proposedFix": "Upgrade downcast error messages in the bridge to include context about what type was expected and what was received. Add input validation to Worker.create and related methods.",
  "workaround": "Ensure NativeConnection is properly instantiated and passed to Worker.create as shown in corrected examples.",
  "resolution": "invalid",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was user error (missing NativeConnection parameter). Commenter suggested the downcast error is fundamentally input validation and that IDEs should catch type errors.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Failed to downcast is input validation, it's a type error. We can add more input validation at worker creation time but I think that's overkill, an IDE should catch this.",
