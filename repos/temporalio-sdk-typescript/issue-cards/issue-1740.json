  "userImpact": "Users cannot suppress webpack bundler output through bundlerOptions.webpackConfigHook, forcing them to modify SDK source code or use alternative bundling approaches.",
  "rootCause": "The webpackConfigHook configuration is ignored for the logger output - webpack stats configuration only affects webpack's internal reporting, not the SDK's logging of webpackOutput in bundler.ts line 270.",
  "proposedFix": "Either provide a way to configure logging verbosity through bundlerOptions, or remove the automatic logging of webpackOutput in bundler.ts.",
  "workaround": "Call bundleWorkflowCode() directly instead of Worker.create() and pass a custom Logger instance with suppressed output.",
