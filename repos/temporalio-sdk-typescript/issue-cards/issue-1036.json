  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily exclude third-party modules that import node: dependencies from being bundled, requiring manual webpack configuration workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow bundler does not compile for the node target, causing webpack to be unable to process dependencies in the node: namespace, and `ignoreModules` configuration does not provide the intended exclusion mechanism.",
  "proposedFix": "Configure webpack externals to handle node: prefixed modules, either as a static map or through a callback function that intercepts the request and returns a dummy object.",
  "workaround": "Override the webpack `externals` configuration with a function that checks for node:crypto (or other modules) and returns 'var {}' or a callback wrapper around Temporal's default externals.",
