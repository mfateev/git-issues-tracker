  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Developers cannot use esbuild for faster workflow bundling due to incompatibilities with SDK's `__temporal_*` pseudo-modules and lack of documentation.",
  "rootCause": "The SDK's bundling process relies on `__temporal_*` pseudo-modules and custom bundler logic that is tightly coupled to webpack; esbuild lacks support for these mechanisms.",
  "proposedFix": "Use global injection to replace `__temporal_*` hacks or provide stub modules that can be replaced before execution, rather than relying on require()-based pseudo-modules.",
  "workaround": "Manually sed-replace the bundled output to remove `__temporal_custom_payload_converter` imports, but this is fragile and unsupported.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "The maintainer noted that bundling details are integral to workflow sandboxing and regularly change; custom bundlers are too fragile to officially support. Official esbuild support was deferred as a future enhancement.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Custom bundling processes are therefore very fragile and might require maintenance effort on each SDK release",
