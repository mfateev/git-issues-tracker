  "severity": "low",
  "userImpact": "Users who need to optimize container size or reduce deployment artifacts are currently forced to include webpack even if they don't use the bundling feature.",
  "rootCause": "webpack and the bundler module are eagerly imported at the index/worker level, making them impossible to tree-shake or exclude from bundles even when unused.",
  "proposedFix": "Export a stub bundleWorkflowCode function that uses dynamic import internally to lazily load the actual implementation, or move bundler to an optional package that can be dynamically imported.",
  "workaround": "User demonstrated a patch on build outputs using dynamic require: require(\"./workflow/bundler\").bundleWorkflowCode instead of eager imports. This requires patching compiled JavaScript.",
