  "summary": "The failure type for non-TemporalFailure exceptions is incorrectly set to 'Error' instead of the actual exception class name. When throwing a custom error that extends Error (but not TemporalFailure), the type should reflect the actual class name like 'MyFailure' rather than the parent 'Error' class.",
