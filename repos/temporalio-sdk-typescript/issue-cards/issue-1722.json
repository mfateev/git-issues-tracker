  "summary": "Feature request to include decoded gRPC error details on all errors thrown from the Client API, not just specific high-level error classes. This would help users diagnose operational issues by providing access to server-provided error metadata, though it requires solving challenges around type checking, error serialization, and recursive protobuf decoding.",
