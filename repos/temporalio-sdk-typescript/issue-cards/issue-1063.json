  "summary": "TypeScript type incompatibility between Temporal's abort-controller polyfill and standard library AbortSignal prevents using cancellationSignal with libraries expecting standard AbortSignal types. The SDK uses a third-party AbortController for Node 14 compatibility, causing type mismatches with newer versions that have the throwIfAborted method.",

  "rootCause": "Temporal uses abort-controller polyfill for Node 14 compatibility, but its types don't match the standard library AbortSignal which includes throwIfAborted method added in later Node versions.",
  "proposedFix": "Either use abort-controller/polyfill which returns the native implementation when available, or manually add throwIfAborted method to objects created, or align types with Node 16+ standard library.",
