  "userImpact": "Developers can be confused by `@` prefix aliases appearing like package scopes, and generated projects cannot be published without additional tooling due to broken path aliases.",
  "rootCause": "TypeScript path aliases are not resolved during `npm pack`, breaking relative imports in published packages. The `@` prefix conflicts with npm package scope naming conventions.",
  "proposedFix": "Either change the alias prefix to avoid confusion with package scopes, or use ttsc to translate path aliases before publication. Ultimately, keep only the essential `@activities` alias for webpack resolver functionality.",
  "workaround": "Use `ttsc` tool to translate path aliases before publishing the project.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved by removing unnecessary aliases and keeping only the special `@activities` alias required for the custom webpack resolver, making it configurable if needed.",

  "keyQuote": "The aliases are definitely broken after `npm pack`. We can get rid of the interfaces alias but we need the activities alias for the module loader.",
