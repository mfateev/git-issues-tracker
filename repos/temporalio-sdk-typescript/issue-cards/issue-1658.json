  "rootCause": "OTel v2 represents a breaking change that cannot be implemented in the existing v1 package without breaking existing setups.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a new package (e.g., @temporalio/interceptors-opentelemetry2) that supports OTel v2 while maintaining v1 compatibility. Implementation roadmap: (1) Complete OTel v1 event coverage improvements, (2) Extend v1 to new plugin form, (3) Address serialization issues in workflow/sink layer, (4) Duplicate v1 as v2 package with necessary adaptations.",
  "workaround": "Users can create their own copy of the OTel interceptors for v2 support outside the official SDK.",
