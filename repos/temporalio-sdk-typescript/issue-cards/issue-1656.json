  "summary": "When a workflow function is bound to an instance using `.bind()`, the function's name property becomes `bound <name>`, causing the workflow type to be incorrectly deduced as `bound example` instead of `example`. This mismatch prevents workers from executing the workflow since they register with the original function name.",
