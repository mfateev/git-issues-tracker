  "userImpact": "Users attempting to pass async callback functions to `condition()` encounter TypeScript errors and confusion about expected function signatures.",
  "rootCause": "The `condition()` function design intentionally does not support async callbacks—it expects synchronous functions returning boolean values for checking local state, not async operations.",

  "workaround": "Use synchronous functions that return boolean values, checking local variables or array states instead of performing async operations.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainer clarified that `condition()` is designed to accept only synchronous functions returning boolean values for state checks, not async callbacks. The API documentation correctly reflects this design.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The function argument passed to `condition` can't be asynchronous, and must return a boolean. Typical usage is that `fn` is an inline function that returns the value of a local boolean variable.",
