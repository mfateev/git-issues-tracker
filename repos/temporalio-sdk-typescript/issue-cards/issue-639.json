  "summary": "Feature request to disable GitHub's \"require branches to be up to date before merging\" requirement for faster PR merging. Currently, every time a PR is merged, all other PRs are blocked and require manual updating and rerunning of checks.",

  "userImpact": "Reduces developer friction and PR merge time by eliminating the requirement to update and re-run checks on every PR after another PR is merged.",
  "rootCause": "GitHub branch protection rule requiring PRs to be up to date with main before merging causes cascading delays when multiple PRs exist.",
  "proposedFix": "Disable the branch protection rule that requires branches to be up to date before merging, accepting the trade-off of potentially discovering test failures on main rather than before merge.",
  "workaround": "Manually click 'Update branch' and use 'Enable auto-merge', though this still requires manual intervention for failed checks and can fail if another PR is merged concurrently.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The repository maintainer (bergundy) disabled the GitHub branch protection setting as requested.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "We uncheck this box... Pro: takes much less time to merge PRs. Con: slightly less safe: delayed knowledge of failure.",
