  "userImpact": "Users cannot use simplified single-file workflow structures and must organize workflows in directories, limiting flexibility in project structure.",
  "rootCause": "The isolate-builder module requires file extensions and only supports directory-based workflow loading, not individual files.",
  "proposedFix": "Make workflowsPath flexible to accept both files and directories by adjusting module resolution logic and supporting require.resolve() patterns for both workflowsPath and interceptorModules.",
  "workaround": "Use directory-based structure with workflows in a separate directory (e.g., ./workflows/ instead of ./workflows.js)",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implementation made workflowsPath flexible to support both single files and directories through module resolution adjustments.",
