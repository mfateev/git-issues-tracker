  "userImpact": "Users cannot effectively debug workflow errors because failure messages lack stack traces and proper formatting of thrown objects.",
  "rootCause": "The workflow activation error reporting mechanism doesn't capture full error context (stack trace, cause chain) and doesn't handle non-Error throws properly.",
  "proposedFix": "Fill in stack_trace when Error is thrown, handle non-Error throws with JSON.stringify, propagate error.cause property, and optionally make source field more specific.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Most improvements were implemented: stack traces now captured, non-Error values JSON stringified with warning message, and error.cause property propagated. The source field enhancement was deferred as potentially breaking.",
