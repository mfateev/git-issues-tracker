  "summary": "User encountered `crypto.getRandomValues() not supported` error when using the uuid npm package in workflow code. The issue was resolved by explaining that workflow code must be deterministic and recommending the use of `uuid4` from `@temporalio/workflow` package or moving UUID generation to activities.",

  "userImpact": "Users attempting to generate UUIDs in workflow code using standard npm packages encounter runtime failures and need to refactor their code.",
  "rootCause": "The `uuid` npm package uses the built-in `crypto.getRandomValues()` which cannot be imported in workflow code due to non-determinism requirements. Workflow code bundler did not catch this dependency early enough.",
  "proposedFix": "Use the `uuid4` function from `@temporalio/workflow` package which implements a replay-safe random number generator, or move UUID generation logic to activities.",
  "workaround": "Use the `uuid4` function exported by the `@temporalio/workflow` package instead of the npm uuid package.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "User acknowledged the solution and understood that non-deterministic logic should be moved to activities or use the provided uuid4 function.",

  "keyQuote": "Workflow code must be deterministic. Use the uuid4 function exported by the @temporalio/workflow package which internally uses a replay-safe random number generator.",
