  "summary": "The `instanceof WorkflowNotFoundError` check fails to catch the error thrown when a workflow doesn't exist. The issue is caused by multiple versions of `@temporalio/common` being installed, and the workaround is to check `err.name === 'WorkflowNotFoundError'` or import from `@temporalio/client` instead.",

  "rootCause": "Multiple versions of @temporalio/common installed, causing instanceof checks to fail due to different class instances in the prototype chain.",

  "keyQuote": "This is likely due to multiple versions of `@temporalio/common` installed. Try changing the import to: `import { WorkflowNotFoundError } from '@temporalio/client`",
