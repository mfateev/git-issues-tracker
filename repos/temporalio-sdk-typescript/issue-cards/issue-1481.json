  "userImpact": "Developers experience slow TypeScript compilation times (1+ second for client imports) which impacts development velocity in monorepo projects.",
  "rootCause": "Large barrel index exports and a massive 49k-line proto declaration file (root.d.ts, 2.67 MB) that must be fully parsed and type-checked sequentially instead of in parallel.",
  "proposedFix": "Remove barrel imports and use deep path imports for @temporalio/client; split root.d.ts into multiple focused files (coresdk.d.ts, temporal.d.ts, google.d.ts, grpc.d.ts) for parallel type checking.",

  "keyQuote": "Importing the @temporalio/client package takes 1 second... The generated file at @temporalio/proto/protos/root.d.ts is massive and is most likely consuming most of the parsing/checking time.",
