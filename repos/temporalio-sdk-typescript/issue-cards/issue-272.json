  "userImpact": "Users may accidentally define signal or query handlers after workflow start, causing signals to be lost or queries to fail, but lack visibility into this bug.",
  "rootCause": "Imperative dynamic API allows signals and queries to be defined after workflow start time, creating a window where messages arrive before handlers exist.",
  "proposedFix": "Buffer signals until a listener is registered; queue them for delivery when the handler is defined. For queries, ensure they're registered before invocation or return an error.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implementation decided to buffer signals until listener is registered and require queries to be registered before invocation.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "We're buffering signals until a listener is registered. Queries must be registered before invoked or the caller will get an error.",
