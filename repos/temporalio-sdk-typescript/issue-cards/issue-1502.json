  "summary": "@temporalio/worker's deep import from @opentelemetry/api's build directory breaks when @opentelemetry/api is upgraded to version 1.9.0, as the import path './build/src/trace/NoopTracer' is no longer exported. The issue was resolved by removing the dependency on NoopTracer in a later version.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot install and use @temporalio/worker with the latest version of @opentelemetry/api (1.9.0), forcing them to manually lock the package to an older version.",
  "rootCause": "The @temporalio/worker package was doing a deep import directly from the @opentelemetry/api build directory (./build/src/trace/NoopTracer), which is not exposed in the package's exports. OpenTelemetry 1.9.0 changed its exports, breaking this import path.",
  "proposedFix": "Update all @temporalio packages to version >1.9.0, which removed the dependency on NoopTracer as mentioned in PR #1269.",
  "workaround": "Lock @opentelemetry/api version between 1.3.0 and 1.6.0 to avoid the breaking change.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The import on NoopTracer was removed in PR #1269, resolving the compatibility issue when updating to newer versions of @opentelemetry/api.",
