  "userImpact": "Users setting up OpenTelemetry tracing encounter incorrect span timings, missing service names in traces, unfiltered SDK-internal spans, and broken parent-child relationships in child workflows.",
  "rootCause": "OTEL resource not being passed to makeWorkflowExporter; span hierarchy not properly maintained for child workflows; internal traces not filtered by default",
  "proposedFix": "Make OTEL resource required in makeWorkflowExporter; implement proper span parent-child linking for child workflows; add filtering for SDK-internal traces; ensure ContinueAsNew is traced",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Child workflows are not connected to root workflows (i.e. the child workflow span `workflow.execute` should be a child span of the root `workflow.schedule`)",
