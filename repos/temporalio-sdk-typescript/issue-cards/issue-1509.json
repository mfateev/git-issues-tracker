  "userImpact": "Users cannot deploy Temporal workers to ARM64 Docker containers using Alpine or other musl-based Linux distributions, preventing containerization on modern M-series Macs and ARM servers.",
  "rootCause": "The core-bridge native module is compiled for glibc and requires the __register_atfork symbol which is not available in musl libc implementations used by Alpine Linux.",

  "workaround": "Use a glibc-based Linux distribution such as Debian Bullseye instead of Alpine for the Docker image.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
