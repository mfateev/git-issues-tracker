After discovering and following the building.md documentation and running lerna clean, the build succeeded.

  "userImpact": "macOS developers cannot build the SDK without discovering and following additional undocumented setup steps beyond the main contributing instructions.",
  "rootCause": "The Environment setup instructions in the main documentation do not mention the Rust/Cargo requirement for building the core-bridge package on macOS.",
  "proposedFix": "Add verification step 'which cargo' at the end of setup instructions and include a troubleshooting section mentioning 'npx lerna clean -- -f && npm ci' for environment resets.",
  "workaround": "Follow the building.md instructions and run 'lerna clean -f' before building.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was clarified through discussion. Contributors should follow building.md for cross-compilation setup, but basic setup should be verified with 'which cargo' check. Troubleshooting section was suggested.",
