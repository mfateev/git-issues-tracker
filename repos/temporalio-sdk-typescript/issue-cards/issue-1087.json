  "summary": "User encountered 'too many filter conditions specified' error when querying active workflows using WorkflowClient.list() with a two-condition filter, while the same query works with direct gRPC calls to listWorkflowExecutions(). The issue was identified as a server limitation related to visibility database configuration, not an SDK bug.",

  "rootCause": "Server-side limitation: the visibility database (Cassandra/ScyllaDB without ElasticSearch) does not support the enhanced visibility queries that the SDK attempts to construct.",

  "workaround": "Use the direct gRPC connection's listWorkflowExecutions() method instead of WorkflowClient.list(). Alternatively, enable ElasticSearch as the visibility database to support enhanced queries.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as not planned - determined to be a server configuration issue rather than an SDK bug. User's persistence layer (Cassandra/ScyllaDB) does not support enhanced visibility without ElasticSearch.",
