  "userImpact": "Developers receive confusing gRPC error messages instead of clear API documentation indicating namespace is required.",
  "rootCause": "The low-level gRPC API (auto-generated from protobuf) does not enforce required properties, and protobuf 3 lacks a concept of required fields.",
  "proposedFix": "Mark namespace as mandatory in API documentation or add runtime validation in the client library.",
  "workaround": "Use the high-level client.workflow.list() API instead, which handles namespace requirements internally and provides better developer experience.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue resolved by recommending users use the high-level client.workflow.list() API instead of the low-level gRPC connection.workflowService API, which provides better error handling and required parameter validation.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "I strongly recommend you use client.workflow.list instead, which is the high level API to list workflows. It provides a more intuitive API, and handle pagination internally.",
