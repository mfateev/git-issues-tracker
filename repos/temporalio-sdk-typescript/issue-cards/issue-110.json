  "userImpact": "Users encounter worker crashes when running hello world samples if old task queue entries exist, requiring task queue name changes to work around the issue.",
  "rootCause": "Payload metadata contains non-unicode characters from old workflow executions that the data converter cannot deserialize, causing the worker to fail.",

  "keyQuote": "This problem goes away when I change task queue names, so I think it may be due to an old entry in the task queue causing issues.",
