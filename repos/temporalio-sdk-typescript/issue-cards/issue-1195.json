  "rootCause": "The SDK currently ships pre-formatted logs from Core without extracting individual attributes/metadata fields that are available in the Core API's telemetry structures.",
  "proposedFix": "Extract log attributes from the Core telemetry API and pass them to the lang logger, with field name casing normalization (e.g., workflow_type to workflowType).",

  "keyQuote": "Especially log entries like `Failing workflow task` need to include the workflow id and run id for them to be actionable.",
