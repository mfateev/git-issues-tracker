  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users need better control over connection retry behavior and timeouts to handle network issues and service unavailability more robustly.",
  "rootCause": "The TypeScript SDK lacked configurable retry and timeout settings at both gRPC and SDK levels, unlike the Java SDK implementation.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented a configurable retryer that does not retry deadline exceeded errors by default, addressing the core requirement.",

  "keyQuote": "Closing this since the retryer exists, is configurable, and does not retry deadline exceeded errors by default which is the right thing to do.",
