  "summary": "TypeScript compilation fails in projects created with `npx @temporalio/create` on Node 20 because the `es2023` library definitions are not available in the pinned TypeScript 4.x version. The create tool updates `@tsconfig/node16` to `@tsconfig/node20`, which references `es2023`, but the project still uses TypeScript 4.x which doesn't support that library.",

  "userImpact": "New users following the official documentation cannot successfully create and run projects on Node 20 without manual fixes.",
  "rootCause": "The create-project tool automatically updates @tsconfig/nodeXX based on the user's Node version, but the pinned TypeScript version (4.x) doesn't support the es2023 library definitions that node20 tsconfig requires.",
  "proposedFix": "Either bump TypeScript version to 5.x in all samples, or stop automatically updating @tsconfig/nodeXX and use a version-agnostic config instead.",
  "workaround": "Manually downgrade @tsconfig/node20 to @tsconfig/node16 or upgrade TypeScript to 5.x.",
