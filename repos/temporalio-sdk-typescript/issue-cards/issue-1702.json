  "rootCause": "SDK download happens silently in the background with a 20s timeout, but test frameworks default to 2s timeout, causing tests to fail before download completes. No logging about the download process.",
  "proposedFix": "Trigger an informational message when SDK download is required, and potentially increase test timeout handling or improve download progress feedback.",
  "workaround": "Increase Jest/Mocha timeout to >20s to allow the download to complete.",
