  "userImpact": "Users need a clearer, more intuitive API for specifying workflow and node_modules paths when creating workers.",
  "rootCause": "Current workDir and nodeModulesPath parameters are not intuitive; using require.resolve() would be more ergonomic",
  "proposedFix": "Use require.resolve('./workflows') to resolve workflow paths instead of manual workDir specification",
  "workaround": "Users can manually specify nodeModulesPath as an absolute path if the default resolution doesn't work",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The team converged on using require.resolve() for path resolution, which is simpler than adding utility functions",

  "keyQuote": "even better IMHO: Worker.create({ workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'), activities, taskQueue: 'test' })",
