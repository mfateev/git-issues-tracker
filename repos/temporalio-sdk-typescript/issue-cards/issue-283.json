The issue discusses whether to enforce stricter validation at registration time or improve documentation to guide proper activity usage.",

  "userImpact": "Developers may accidentally import activity implementations directly, causing workflows to use unintended activity registrations or encounter webpack errors during bundling.",
  "rootCause": "Workflows can only use activity type definitions at runtime, not implementations. TypeScript's type system is lost at runtime, making it impossible to enforce proper activity usage at compile time.",
  "proposedFix": "Improve documentation with a FAQ entry explaining proper activity usage patterns and warning about webpack errors from incorrect imports.",
  "workaround": "Use the same activities registered in the worker rather than importing implementations directly; rely on createActivityHandle's type inference for safety.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Cannot be fixed due to TypeScript's type erasure at runtime. Solution is documentation-focused: help users understand proper activity patterns and troubleshoot webpack errors.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Workflows can't import activity implementations, only type definitions, these types are lost at runtime. Due to this limitation it isn't possible to \"fix\" the issue.",
