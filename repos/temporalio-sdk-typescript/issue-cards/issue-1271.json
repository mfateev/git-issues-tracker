  "summary": "The TypeScript SDK's core-bridge native library doesn't support musl-based systems (like Alpine Linux). Users need the ability to build musl-compatible native libraries to run workers in Alpine containers.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users requiring Alpine Docker images cannot run TypeScript SDK workers without self-building the native library.",
  "rootCause": "The target environment detection logic in core-bridge cannot recognize musl-based systems because Node.js provides no direct indication of the C library in use.",
  "proposedFix": "Modify the target environment detection logic in packages/core-bridge/common.js to recognize musl environments by inspecting process or os APIs, and add musl build targets to the CI test matrix.",
  "workaround": "Users can manually build the native library by installing build tools, setting RUSTFLAGS and BUILD_CORE_RELEASE environment variables, and copying the compiled artifact.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Superseded by #1621, indicating the feature was implemented through a more comprehensive solution.",

  "keyQuote": "the TS logic that identify the current target can't recognize the fact that it is running on a musl-based system",
