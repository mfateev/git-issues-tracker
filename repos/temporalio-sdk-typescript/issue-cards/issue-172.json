  "summary": "@temporalio/proto package had an unnecessary dependency on @temporalio/core-bridge, which was added only to work around a Lerna versioning issue. This caused clients to indirectly depend on core-bridge despite the Rust compilation overhead being irrelevant to proto consumers.",

  "userImpact": "Clients consuming @temporalio/proto are forced to depend on core-bridge, introducing unnecessary Rust compilation overhead and build complexity.",
  "rootCause": "Lerna doesn't increment a package's version unless something changes in git, so core-bridge was added as a dependency to @temporalio/proto to trigger version bumps.",
  "proposedFix": "Move proto definitions into the proto package or create a separate package for the sdk-core submodule. The issue was resolved by using a single version for all SDK packages, allowing safe removal of the dependency.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Adopted a single version numbering scheme for all SDK packages, eliminating the need for the artificial dependency on core-bridge.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "the client relies on the proto package while it shouldn't rely on core because of the Rust compilation dependency",
