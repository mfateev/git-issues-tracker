  "summary": "Feature request to expose `updateId` to Update handlers in the TypeScript SDK for deduplication across continue-as-new boundaries. Currently, updateId is only available to workflow interceptors, not to the update handler itself.",

  "subcategory": "update-handler",
  "apis": [
    "updateInfo"

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Workflow implementers need access to updateId to implement deduplication guarantees across continue-as-new boundaries, which is currently not possible without using workarounds.",
  "rootCause": "The updateId field is passed to interceptors but not exposed through a dedicated API to update handlers.",
  "proposedFix": "Expose an `updateInfo()` function that provides access to updateId and other update execution context, potentially leveraging asyncLocalStorage to make it generally available for queries and signals as well.",
  "workaround": "Capture the updateId from a workflow interceptor and make it accessible to the update handler code using async local storage.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The feature was implemented to expose updateId through an updateInfo() function to update handlers.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Workflow implementers may have legitimate reasons to extend that guarantee across continue-as-new boundary. Doing that effectively require access to the `updateId`",
