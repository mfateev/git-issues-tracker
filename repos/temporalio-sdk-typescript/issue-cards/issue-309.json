When users accidentally pass a workflow ID string instead of an object, they get an unclear error message. Request to split this into separate `createWorkflowHandle` and `getExistingWorkflowHandle` functions for better API clarity.",

  "rootCause": "The function attempts to serve two distinct purposes (creating new workflows and retrieving existing ones) with overloaded signatures, making it prone to user error without clear guidance.",
  "proposedFix": "Split `createWorkflowHandle` into two separate functions: `createWorkflowHandle` for creating new workflows and `getExistingWorkflowHandle` for retrieving existing workflows. Additionally, add validation in dev mode to detect when a workflowId string is passed instead of an object.",
