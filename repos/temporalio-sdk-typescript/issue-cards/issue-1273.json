  "rootCause": "Network binding issue specific to how Docker initializes the container environment - likely related to host address resolution or network interface availability at container startup time versus manual execution.",

  "workaround": "Manually shell into the container and run the worker initialization command directly (e.g., shell exec form in Dockerfile or manual docker exec).",
  "resolution": "stale",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue closed due to lack of response from original poster and insufficient debugging information. Maintainers requested more context (NativeConnection options, Worker options, Dockerfile) to diagnose.",
