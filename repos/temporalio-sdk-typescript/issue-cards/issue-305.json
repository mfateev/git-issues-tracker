  "userImpact": "Developers may experience confusing non-deterministic behavior when old worker processes interfere with new ones, making debugging difficult.",
  "rootCause": "Multiple worker processes running simultaneously on the same machine can pick up tasks intended for the newer worker version.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a development-time warning that searches for other worker processes on the machine and logs their PIDs with a suggestion to kill them, possibly integrated with task queue introspection via tctl API.",
  "workaround": "Manually stop any other worker processes before starting development, or use worker versioning for deployments.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Resolved as wontfix with suggestion to use worker versioning instead, which is the proper solution for managing multiple code versions.",

  "keyQuote": "There is another worker process running on this machine. If it was started with an older version of your Worker and Activity code, we recommend stopping it",
