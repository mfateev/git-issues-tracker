  "summary": "When using ts-node with swc-loader, the bundler sometimes includes regenerator-runtime in the webpack bundle even though it's not needed for Node 14+ target, causing module resolution failures. The issue was resolved by including swc-loader in the SDK.",

  "rootCause": "swc-loader was transforming generators and async functions to include regenerator-runtime even when the build target (Node 14+) supports them natively; issue was in upstream swc project but workaround needed in SDK configuration.",
