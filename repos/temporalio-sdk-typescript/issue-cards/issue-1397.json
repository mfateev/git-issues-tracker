  "userImpact": "Users cannot efficiently wait for multiple signals in workflows, forcing them to use problematic polling loops that cause memory issues in production.",
  "rootCause": "TypeScript SDK lacked a direct equivalent to JVM's Workflow.await for coordinating multiple signals, leading users to implement inefficient polling patterns.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement a workflow.condition or workflow.await method that allows waiting for multiple signals without memory overhead.",
  "workaround": "Use a while loop polling with workflow.sleep, though this causes OutOfMemory issues on workers due to loop iteration caching.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue author discovered workflow.condition already exists for this exact purpose, providing the needed functionality.",
