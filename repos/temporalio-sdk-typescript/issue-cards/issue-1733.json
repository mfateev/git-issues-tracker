  "rootCause": "The TypeScript SDK implementation includes validation that rejects maximumAttempts === 0, while the official Temporal documentation states this value should mean unlimited retries. The validation appears to be an overzealous constraint not present in other SDKs.",
  "proposedFix": "Either align the TypeScript SDK to accept 0 as a valid value for unlimited retries (per documentation), or align all SDKs and documentation on a single approach such as using undefined or Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY.",
  "workaround": "Use undefined or Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY instead of 0 to specify unlimited retries.",
