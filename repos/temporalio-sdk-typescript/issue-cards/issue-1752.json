  "summary": "Feature request to add Activity support for Worker Versioning, allowing Workflows to specify which version of an Activity to use. Currently, teams must work around this limitation by encoding Activity version into task queue names despite using Worker Versioning for both Workflows and Activities.",

  "proposedFix": "Add `versioningOverride` to `ActivityOptions` and have the Temporal Service use it along with `WorkerDeploymentOptions` to resolve scheduled Activities to Worker Deployments, leveraging existing Workflow Versioning infrastructure.",
  "workaround": "Encode the Activity version into the task queue name, though this is suboptimal when Workers already use Deployments and Versioning.",
