  "summary": "Feature request for a catch-all signal handler in TypeScript workflows to ensure in-order delivery of all signals regardless of type. Currently requires either a single signal type or multiple individual handlers, making it difficult to guarantee ordering across different signal types.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Developers must use workarounds (single signal type or fat handler) to guarantee in-order signal processing across multiple signal types.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Add a setGlobalSignalHandler API that acts as a catch-all for any signal type not handled by specific handlers, with catch-all only triggering when no more specific handler is defined.",
  "workaround": "Use a single 'fat handler' signal type or only define one signal handler to process all signals in order.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Feature was implemented with catch-all handler API added to SDK.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Easy to add, has been brought up before, API TBD. For the behavior, I'd recommend this being a catch all, meaning it doesn't get triggered if a more specific handler is set.",
