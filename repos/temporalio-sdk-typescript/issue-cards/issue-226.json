  "summary": "Feature request for official testing support in Node.js SDK, specifically for workflows and activities. Users need a TestWorkflowEnvironment similar to Java and Go SDKs, and better example projects with jest/eslint configuration.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Without proper testing infrastructure, developers cannot easily test workflows in the Node.js SDK, limiting its adoption despite testing being a major selling point of Temporal.",
  "rootCause": "Core-based SDKs require a mocked server implementation for time-skipping support, which is a significant undertaking not yet completed for the Node.js SDK.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement TestWorkflowEnvironment for Node.js SDK with time-skipping support and mocked activity context; include basic jest configuration and project references in example projects.",
  "workaround": "Activities can be tested as async functions by mocking Context; workflows can be tested by running them with WorkflowClient, but this is not ideal.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as part of issue cleanup; test framework implementation was planned and subsequently completed for Core-based SDKs.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Testability is a major selling point of Temporal but the Node SDK and its docs are currently lacking... There's no official support for testing Workflows and Activities.",
