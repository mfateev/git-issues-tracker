  "rootCause": "All builtin modules are disallowed to maintain determinism and support multi-runtime compatibility (Deno, browser, etc).",
  "proposedFix": "Provide an exemption for buffer module similar to the existing exemption for assert, or allow users to load polyfills from Webpack bundler.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Team decided not to support Node's Buffer API out-of-the-box to maintain compatibility with other JavaScript runtimes (Deno, browser). Users should use polyfills instead.",
