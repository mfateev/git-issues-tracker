  "rootCause": "Temporal activities are retried indefinitely by default unless they throw non-retryable errors, which differs from standard JavaScript promise behavior and can be counterintuitive.",
  "proposedFix": "Use ApplicationFailure.create({ message: 'foo', nonRetryable: true }) to throw non-retryable errors from activities, allowing workflow-level control over retry decisions.",
