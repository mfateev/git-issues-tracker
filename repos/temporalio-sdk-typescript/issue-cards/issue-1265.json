  "userImpact": "Users who integrate worker logging with external logging systems experience unreadable, fragmented logs with ANSI escape sequences.",
  "rootCause": "Webpack's logger is called multiple times per bundle operation, each call including ANSI color escape sequences that don't display well in non-terminal environments.",
  "proposedFix": "Gather Webpack log output into a single, structured log entry instead of multiple calls with raw output.",
  "workaround": "Implement a custom bundle with a custom Webpack logger that collects all logs and removes ANSI styling before outputting to external systems.",

  "keyQuote": "Webpack calls `log()` repeatedly, and include lot of ANSI-color escape sequences. This is fine and nice when logs are going straight to console, but horrible and hard to understand when logs are captured into some external system",
