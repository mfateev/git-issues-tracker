  "summary": "Webpack compilation fails when importing built-in Node.js libraries like `fs` and `os` in the TypeScript SDK. The issue stems from webpack defaulting to 'web' target instead of 'node', causing it to require polyfills for core Node modules.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot use code that imports built-in Node.js libraries in workflows, blocking compilation and forcing workarounds through activities.",
  "rootCause": "Webpack's default target is 'web' which doesn't support Node.js core modules; workflow isolation also prevents native node API usage.",
  "proposedFix": "Set webpack target to 'node' in configuration to properly resolve built-in libraries.",
  "workaround": "Use activities to access filesystem and other Node.js APIs instead of importing them directly in workflow code.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Deterministic requirement: built-in Node APIs like `fs` cannot be used in workflows due to non-deterministic behavior. Users must use activities for filesystem access.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "`fs` is a native node API and cannot be imported in the Workflow isolate, you should use an activity to access the filesystem.",
