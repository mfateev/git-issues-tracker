  "summary": "Feature request to support weighted random polling of multiple task queues in the TypeScript SDK to implement priority-like functionality and prevent starvation, similar to Faktory workers. The maintainer indicated this requires platform-level support from the Temporal server.",

  "userImpact": "Users cannot implement priority-based task processing without complex workarounds, limiting ability to handle critical tasks before bulk processing.",
  "rootCause": "Temporal server does not support priority queues at the platform level, preventing SDK-level implementation.",
  "proposedFix": "Add support for taskQueue as either an array of queue names, an object with weighted queues (e.g., {critical: 10, default: 1}), or a function to select the next queue dynamically.",
  "workaround": "Create multiple workers with different configurations and use maxConcurrentActivityTaskPolls to manage concurrency per worker.",

  "resolutionDetails": "Platform-level feature that requires Temporal server support. Implementation deferred pending server-side priority queue support (temporal/temporal#1507).",

  "keyQuote": "Priority queues is a platform level feature that is not currently supported. Once Temporal server adds support for this, we can add it to the SDK.",
