  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot properly use MCP tools with the Temporal AI-SDK because tool descriptions are missing and malformed schemas prevent models from parsing tool definitions correctly.",
  "rootCause": "Tool descriptions are being dropped during transformation, and inputSchema contains a nested jsonSchema structure instead of being flattened, which was partially addressed in PR #1890 but not fully applied.",
  "proposedFix": "Ensure tool descriptions are preserved in the transformation pipeline and flatten the inputSchema structure to remove the nested jsonSchema wrapper.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Issue was addressed through PR #1890 and subsequent releases, though the reporter noted the fix required verification with newer versions.",
  "related": [
    1890

  "keyQuote": "You still have a nested jsonSchema inside inputSchema which means that #1890 was not applied successfully. That's making ollama fail to parse the tool.",
