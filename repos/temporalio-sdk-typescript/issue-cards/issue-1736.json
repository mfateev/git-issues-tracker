  "userImpact": "Without this feature, developers risk accidentally exposing API keys and authentication credentials through logs, HTTP responses, and error messages when SDK handle objects are inadvertently serialized.",
  "rootCause": "SDK objects containing sensitive client references lack protection against accidental serialization, allowing internal fields like API keys to be exposed when objects are passed to JSON.stringify or serialization libraries.",
  "proposedFix": "Override toJSON() methods to exclude or mask sensitive fields, redesign data models to prevent serialization of sensitive content, and implement protection mechanisms that work with advanced serialization libraries like superjson.",
