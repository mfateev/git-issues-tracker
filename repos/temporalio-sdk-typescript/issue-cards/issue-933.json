  "summary": "Feature request to create a separate `@temporalio/worker-core` library that excludes bundler dependencies (webpack, @swc/core) to reduce runtime image size. Currently bundler deps are mandatory even when workflow bundling happens in a separate build step, adding ~150MB bloat to distroless images.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users deploying to containerized environments are forced to include large unused bundler dependencies (~150MB) in runtime images, significantly increasing deployment size and bloating distroless images.",
  "rootCause": "Dependencies are structured in @temporalio/worker's package.json such that webpack and @swc/core are listed as runtime dependencies rather than optional dev dependencies, making them impossible to exclude without manual modification.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a separate `@temporalio/worker-core` package containing minimal deps for running a worker, excluded bundler components. The full `@temporalio/worker` could depend on both `worker-core` and bundler components for compatibility, or split into `bundler` and `worker-core` packages with `worker` reexporting both.",
  "workaround": "Use npm `overrides`, yarn `resolutions`, or pnpm `overrides` properties to exclude bundler dependencies; or manually edit package-lock.json to remove @swc/core and swc-loader references.",

  "keyQuote": "@swc/core is around ~150MB, so it adds a lot of bloat to distroless images and goes completely unused if workflow bundling has already happened in a separate build step",
