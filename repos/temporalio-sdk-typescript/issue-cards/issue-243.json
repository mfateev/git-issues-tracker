  "summary": "Feature request to support asynchronous activity completion in TypeScript SDK, similar to Go SDK. Currently activities must return immediately even if work continues asynchronously, requiring workarounds with signals for long-running operations.",
  "category": "feature",
  "subcategory": "activity-completion",
  "apis": [
    "respondActivityTaskCompleted"
  ],
  "components": [
    "worker",

  ],
  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot elegantly handle long-running asynchronous activities without creating extra signals or resource leaks in the worker.",
  "rootCause": "The TypeScript SDK lacks a mechanism to allow the worker to 'forget' about an activity so it can be completed asynchronously without worker tracking.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement asynchronous activity completion support similar to the Go SDK, allowing the worker to release ownership of an activity so it can be completed independently via the service client.",
  "workaround": "Use WorkflowService.respondActivityTaskCompleted directly, but this causes resource leaks as the worker continues tracking the activity.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Core support was added and implementation was planned by bergundy to be done after beta release.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "In the Go SDK you can 'asynchronously complete an activity': we would like the same in node.",
