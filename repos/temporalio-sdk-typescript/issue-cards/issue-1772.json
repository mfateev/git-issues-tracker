  "rootCause": "The extractSourceMap function and SourceMapConsumer load entire source maps into memory without lazy-loading or memory-efficient parsing strategies.",
  "proposedFix": "Add an option to disable source map extraction during bundling via webpackConfigHook, with proper error handling in downstream consumers like addWorkflowBundle.",
