  "rootCause": "WorkflowInfo object is created outside the VM context, so instanceof checks against built-in types fail due to different prototype chains.",
  "proposedFix": "Serialize WorkflowInfo to JSON and deserialize it within the VM context to ensure proper prototype chains, or provide type-safe accessors.",
  "workaround": "Dump to JSON and reconstruct the object within the workflow VM context.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was resolved by ensuring WorkflowInfo objects are properly contextualized within the VM so instanceof checks work correctly.",
