  "rootCause": "gRPC treats connection-level TLS failures as transient errors and retries transparently, masking the actual certificate validation error with a generic 'deadline exceeded' message. TLS libraries close connections without detailed error information on handshake failure.",
  "proposedFix": "Improve error messaging to indicate TLS validation or certificate-related issues when connecting to Temporal Cloud, possibly by detecting and surfacing certificate validation failures before they become generic timeout errors.",
