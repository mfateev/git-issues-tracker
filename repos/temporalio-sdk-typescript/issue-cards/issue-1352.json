  "userImpact": "Users who prefer Pino logging must create custom adapters instead of having native SDK support for both Winston and Pino logging frameworks.",
  "rootCause": "SDK Logger interface was designed to be framework-agnostic but appears Winston-like, making it inconvenient for Pino users who need to implement workarounds.",
  "proposedFix": "The team suggested creating an adaptor class that exposes Pino-style log methods internally using the SDK's Logger signature, leveraging Runtime.logger for all log message funneling.",
  "workaround": "Create a custom logger adaptor class that wraps Pino with the SDK's Logger interface; use ActivityInboundLogInterceptor for activity logging (though deprecated); register custom logger sink for workflow logging.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Team decided SDK must remain logger-framework agnostic. Provided architectural guidance on implementing custom Pino adapters instead of adding native Pino support.",

  "keyQuote": "the SDK itself must remain logger-framework agnostic...there's not that much we can do within the SDK itself to simplify usage of alternate logging APIs",
