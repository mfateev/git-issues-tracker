  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Developers cannot currently use TypeScript's type system to enforce which signals and queries are legal to send to a workflow, limiting the ability to create type-safe signal/query systems.",
  "rootCause": "SignalDefinition and QueryDefinition do not preserve the literal type of the name string, only the string type itself, preventing type-level differentiation between different signals.",
  "proposedFix": "Make the name parameter a generic type parameter in SignalDefinition/QueryDefinition (e.g., Name extends string), allowing the specific signal name to be captured in the type system. Three implementation options discussed: type parameter duplication, curried functions, or opt-in type specificity.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Fixed in PR #1056",

  "keyQuote": "SignalDefinition does not retain the type of its name, making it difficult to create systems that enforce legal signals in the type system",
