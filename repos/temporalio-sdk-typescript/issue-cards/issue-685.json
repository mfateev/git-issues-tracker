  "userImpact": "Users may unknowingly deploy workflows that import forbidden modules, only discovering the issue at runtime rather than during startup validation.",
  "rootCause": "The bundler detects built-in module imports but only logs a warning instead of throwing an error, allowing the worker to start normally.",
  "proposedFix": "Change the warning to a loud failure (throw an error) that prevents worker startup when built-in modules are imported, unless explicitly listed in ignoreModules.",
  "workaround": "Add the module names to WorkerOptions.bundlerOptions.ignoreModules if the modules are not actually used at runtime.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Worker now fails loudly when workflow code imports built-in Node modules, unless they are explicitly whitelisted in bundlerOptions.ignoreModules.",
