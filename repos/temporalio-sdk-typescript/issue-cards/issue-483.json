The requester explored a proof-of-concept and established design principles for supporting both monolithic and microservice architectures while avoiding non-deterministic code patterns.",

  "userImpact": "NestJS developers cannot use familiar decorator-based patterns with Temporal SDK, requiring custom workarounds for dependency injection in activities.",
  "rootCause": "The TypeScript SDK uses a functional paradigm rather than OOP/decorator-based approach that NestJS developers expect, limiting integration with NestJS's module system.",
  "proposedFix": "Create a NestJS module that supports @Workflow() and @InjectActivities() decorators, with workflowsPath supporting both default export functions and object exports. Support for dependency injection through NestJS's container.",
  "workaround": "Community members have built internal packages using higher-order functions for dependency injection, or used third-party packages like nestjs-temporal.",
