  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot debug replayed workflows because logs from interceptors are suppressed during replay, making it difficult to understand workflow behavior.",
  "rootCause": "Logs are being filtered out during workflow replay before they reach the configured sinks/interceptors.",
  "proposedFix": "Make log emission during replay configurable, similar to the Go SDK approach (https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/pull/979).",
  "workaround": "Set log configuration on the sinks level using the configuration option in packages/worker/src/sinks.ts",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was resolved by making log emission during replay configurable at the sinks level, allowing users to opt-in to receiving logs during workflow replay.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "I agree that we should allow logs to be emitted during replays, we just got a contribution for Go SDK to make this configurable.",
