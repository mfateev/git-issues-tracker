  "summary": "Error running Temporal TypeScript SDK in Linux Docker containers without glibc (GNU libc). The core-bridge module fails to load because it only provides x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu binaries, not musl/Alpine-compatible versions, causing missing shared library errors.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users cannot run the TypeScript SDK in lightweight Alpine/musl-based Docker containers, limiting deployment options.",
  "rootCause": "The core-bridge native module is compiled only for glibc (linux-gnu), not for musl. Alpine and other musl-based distributions lack the required glibc shared libraries.",
  "proposedFix": "Build and distribute core-bridge binaries for musl targets (e.g., x86_64-unknown-linux-musl) similar to how other Node.js native libraries like SWC handle it.",
  "workaround": "Use glibc-based Docker images (e.g., node, node-slim) instead of Alpine. Add ca-certificates package if needed for lightweight deployment.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Maintainers documented that musl/Alpine is not supported. Issue closed as a documented limitation, though they noted musl support might be considered in the future.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "Using musl based images (such as Alpine) is not supported. Can you try with a glibc based image, such as node?",
