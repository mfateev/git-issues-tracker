  "userImpact": "Integration tests are disabled, reducing test coverage for OTLP metrics export functionality and preventing validation of metrics export behavior.",
  "rootCause": "Recent update to Core or its underlying dependencies changed how the OTLP emitter handles grpc responses from the collector service, causing the bare HTTP2 mock server to fail validation.",
  "proposedFix": "Rewrite the integration tests to use a more convincing mock OTLP collector that properly handles grpc responses.",
