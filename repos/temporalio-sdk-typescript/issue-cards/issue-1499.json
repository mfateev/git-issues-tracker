  "summary": "Feature request to implement automatic request batching in the TypeScript SDK to prevent gRPC message size errors when scheduling many activities. The SDK currently batches activity scheduling commands into a single request, which can exceed the 4MB gRPC limit when starting ~600 activities, causing workflow freezes and silent failures.",

  "severity": "high",
  "userImpact": "Developers experience silent workflow freezes when scheduling large numbers of activities, with no mechanism to detect or handle gRPC message size limits.",
  "rootCause": "SDK batches all activity scheduling commands into a single gRPC request without checking cumulative message size against the 4MB limit, causing ResourceExhausted errors on retry.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement automatic request splitting to detect when message size approaches 4MB and split commands into smaller batches, or throw a descriptive runtime error if splitting is infeasible. Enhance logging around gRPC size limits.",
  "workaround": "Custom payload compression using data converters, or manually batching activity scheduling in application code (incomplete pilot solution provided).",

  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "The SDK does not provide any built-in mechanism to automatically handle this limitation, nor does it throw a runtime error that could help developers detect and manage the issue proactively.",
