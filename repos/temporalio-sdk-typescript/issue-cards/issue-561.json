  "userImpact": "Users cannot easily access documentation that matches the version of the SDK they are using, creating confusion when API differences exist between versions.",
  "rootCause": "Current documentation is always built from the main branch and deployed as a single version, not tied to released versions of the SDK.",
  "proposedFix": "Implement versioned documentation system where each release gets its own documentation version, potentially deployed from the release branch instead of main for API reference.",
  "workaround": "Users can build and view documentation locally by cloning the repository, checking out a specific version tag, and running the build process locally.",
