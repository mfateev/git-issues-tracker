  "userImpact": "Users can implement dynamic routing of workflows, activities, signals, queries, and updates without pre-registering each specific handler, enabling more flexible and generic implementations.",
  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Register catch-all handlers that receive the operation name as first argument and args as array; signal/query/update handlers should also drain buffered unhandled operations when registered.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Implemented across multiple issues: workflows and signals in #1038, queries in #1639; activities and updates tracked separately in the checklist.",
