  "userImpact": "Users must replay workflows sequentially, causing slow test execution when validating determinism across multiple workflows.",
  "rootCause": "Worker registration and initialization is not parallelizable in current implementation; each replay requires sequential setup.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a batched replay feature that accepts a list of workflow IDs and replays them in parallel, returning results and failures.",
  "workaround": "Use Promise.allSettled to parallelize runReplayHistory calls manually, though this provides limited speedup due to serialized worker initialization.",
  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "Support added in sdk-core which enables batched replay functionality.",

  "keyQuote": "It would be useful to have a feature that allows you to kick off a replay that takes in a list of workflow IDs and replays all of them in parallel",
