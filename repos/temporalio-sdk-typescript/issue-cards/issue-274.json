  "summary": "Feature request for signal total ordering - ensuring signals are processed in the exact order they're received globally across signal types in TypeScript workflows. The discussion explores various implementation approaches including object-based handlers, channel-based queuing, and serial processing utilities.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Users requiring strict signal ordering across multiple signal types must implement custom queuing logic rather than relying on native SDK support.",
  "rootCause": "SDK does not provide built-in support for global signal ordering; only per-signal-type ordering is available.",
  "proposedFix": "Multiple proposals discussed: (1) signals prop as object/function handler, (2) _globalHandler registration, (3) registerSignalHandler API, (4) channel-based user-space implementation with async-mutex.",
  "workaround": "Implement channel-based queuing pattern locally; use async-mutex npm package for serial processing of signals.",
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as not planned - decision made to keep feature in user-space rather than add SDK support, with option to revisit if more requests received.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "this is all possible to implement in userspace. If we get enough requests for this we'll revisit.",
