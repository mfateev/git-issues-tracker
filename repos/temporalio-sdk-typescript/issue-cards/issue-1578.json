  "summary": "Worker fails to start when Node.js --abort-on-uncaught-exception flag is set due to improper VM context configuration during bundle preloading for debuggers. The preload operation causes a TypeError that V8 can't properly track across execution contexts, resulting in process abort instead of graceful error handling.",

  "userImpact": "Workers cannot be started with the --abort-on-uncaught-exception Node option, preventing users from using this safety flag in production environments.",
  "rootCause": "Bundle preloading for debugger support executes code in a VM context where globalThis.__webpack_module_cache__ is undefined. The error occurs in a child execution context where V8's --abort-on-uncaught-exception cannot properly track cross-context exception handling, causing premature process termination.",
  "proposedFix": "Make bundle preloading conditional on debugger presence and consider moving the preload logic to the VM to ensure proper context configuration. Quick fix: add ?? {} suffix to problematic line in bundler, but proper fix requires architectural review.",
