  "rootCause": "Design decision to embed workflow type and options in WorkflowHandle led to different execute() signatures between client and handle.",
  "proposedFix": "Two main proposals: (1) Pass arguments in an array: client.execute<T>('workflow', [arg1, arg2], options), or (2) Switch parameter order: client.execute<T>('workflow', options, arg1, arg2). Also suggested adding a variant that accepts a workflow function directly.",
