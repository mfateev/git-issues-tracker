  "summary": "Feature request to add Deno support to the TypeScript SDK. The request would enable developers to write Temporal code using Deno's native Web APIs and run TypeScript without a build step.",

  "severity": "medium",
  "userImpact": "Developers wanting to use Temporal workflows in Deno environments cannot currently do so, limiting the SDK's compatibility with the Deno runtime.",
  "rootCause": "TypeScript SDK relies heavily on Node.js-specific APIs (Worker Threads, VMs, async hooks, native libraries) that are not fully compatible or available in Deno, requiring significant architectural redesign.",
  "proposedFix": "Redesign key SDK components and potentially the Core SDK to work as a WASM module instead of NAPI library, with compatibility abstractions for Deno's implementations.",
  "workaround": null,
  "resolution": "wontfix",
  "resolutionDetails": "Closed as a long-term objective that would require considerable rewriting of multiple components. The project uses a different system to track and prioritize large-scale objectives.",
  "related": [],
  "keyQuote": "In practice, I expect that we'll probably need to rewrite/redesign several key components of the TypeScript SDK to get it to run reliably and efficiently on Deno.",
