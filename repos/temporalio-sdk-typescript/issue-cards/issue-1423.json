  "summary": "CancellationScope.nonCancellable does not prevent cancellation when a condition has a timeout, allowing CancelledFailure to propagate into the nonCancellable scope. The root issue is that timeouts are implemented via a cancellable CancellationScope that inherits cancellation from parent scopes even when nested inside a nonCancellable scope.",

  "userImpact": "Developers cannot reliably use conditions with timeouts inside nonCancellable scopes, breaking expected behavior during cleanup operations and preventing proper cancellation control.",
  "rootCause": "The timeout feature in condition is implemented through a cancellable CancellationScope that inherits cancellation from parent scopes, bypassing the nonCancellable boundary. The root scope propagates cancellation to all cancellable scopes even when nested inside nonCancellable scopes.",
  "proposedFix": "Add an option to disable automatic cancellation propagation from parent scopes, or ensure nonCancellable scopes properly isolate their children from parent cancellation.",
  "workaround": "Use Promise.race with a sleep timer instead of condition timeout, combined with checking parent scope cancellability.",
