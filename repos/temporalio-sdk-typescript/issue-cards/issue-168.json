  "summary": "Feature request to improve activity registration and import patterns in TypeScript SDK. Currently uses scoped imports (@activities/something) for implicit type safety, but community members suggest alternative approaches: Context.activities<ActivityInterface>() for flexible registration or enforcing a single entry point (@activities/index.ts) to prevent duplicates.",

  "rootCause": null,
  "proposedFix": "Three options discussed: 1) Support imports from parent directories (../activities), 2) Use Context.activities<T>() with Worker registration for flexible DI, 3) Enforce single @activities/index.ts entry point to prevent duplicates and confusion.",

  "resolution": "fixed",

  "keyQuote": "The @activities idiom still strikes me as odd. I'd prefer if this were changed to something unambiguous and preferably explicit.",
