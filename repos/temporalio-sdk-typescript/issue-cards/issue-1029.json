  "severity": "critical",
  "userImpact": "Users may be exposed to a critical memory safety vulnerability in transitive dependencies that could lead to data corruption or application crashes.",
  "rootCause": "In bumpalo prior to 3.11.1, the lifetime of the iterator produced by Vec::into_iter() is not constrained to the lifetime of the Bump that allocated the vector's memory, causing use-after-free accesses when the Bump is dropped.",

  "resolution": "fixed",
  "resolutionDetails": "The issue was automatically closed by Mend because the vulnerable library was no longer part of the dependency inventory (likely resolved through dependency updates).",
