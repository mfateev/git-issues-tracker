  "userImpact": "Users generating reports from large numbers of workflow execution results face unacceptable processing times that scale linearly with execution count.",
  "rootCause": "Sequential retrieval of workflow results requires a separate API call per execution, creating a bottleneck for bulk operations.",
  "proposedFix": "Add a dedicated method for batched result retrieval that allows concurrent fetching of multiple execution results, potentially using Promise.all() to parallelize requests.",
  "workaround": "User can manually chunk workflows.executions into batches and use Promise.all() to fetch results concurrently, though they are uncertain if this is the correct approach.",
